# Watch
Watch Fanfic organized into one file and with a navbar and chapter selection

Like it says on the tin, its all chapters of "The Watch" collected from Groups.io (https://caerazkaban.groups.io/g/main/topics) organized into one HTML File, Formatted to my liking and then achored to make navigation easier
