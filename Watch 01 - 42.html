</P>
<P>Minerva was sitting in her office doing
paperwork when the silence was disturbed by a hesitant knock on the
door. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come in,” the professor called
out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The door cracked open to reveal her
favorite bushy haired Gryffindor. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Can I speak with you for a
moment, Professor?&quot; Hermione asked nervously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; Minerva agreed,
&quot;come in.&quot; She waited until after the girl had settled
herself. &quot;What is it, Ms. Granger?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's about Harry and Ron,”
Hermione began. She bit her lower lip in distress as she tried to
work up the courage to ask her Head of House for advice on how to
repair a wounded friendship. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're worried about their so called
duel right?” the professor suggested with suppressed a smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ron flung a curse at Harry and Harry
put Ron in the hospital wing,” Hermione sobbed, “what am I
suppose to do?” And how was she going to get them to reconcile
their differences? Fourth year had been one of the worst of her life
due both to the dangers of the tournament and the rift that had
formed between Harry and Ron before the first task. &quot;What if I
can't fix this?&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why don't we examine what happened?”
Minerva suggested gently. “What preceded the fight?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They were arguing about something or
other,” Hermione said, “I'm not sure what.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then Mr. Weasley tried to hex Mr.
Potter,” Minerva prompted, “what curse did he use?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Double vision hex,” Hermione
replied instantly, having spent two hours grilling every witness so
as to have as much information as possible before she set out to
right things. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And what spell did Mr. Potter reply
with?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm not sure Professor,” Hermione
admitted, “But it caused Ron's hands and feet to grow together and
. . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And would it surprise you to learn
that Mr. Potter was attempting to cast a clapping hex?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You didn't see the 'fight' did you?”
Minerva asked, her lips twitching a bit. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was in the library when it
happened, Professor,” Hermione agreed, “but the other students
told me what happened and it was horrible.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would it surprise you to learn that
Mr. Weasley immediately demanded that Mr. Potter teach him that hex?”
Minerva asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But . . . the fight . . . I . . .”
Hermione sputtered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How many similar 'fights' have the
Gryffindor boys engaged in this year?” Minerva asked dryly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A lot,” Hermione admitted with a
blush. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A lot,” Minerva agreed with a
smile, “most of which I turn a blind eye to.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But this one is different,”
Hermione protested.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes it is,” Minerva agreed, “for
one thing Mr. Weasley ended up in the hospital. For another, Mr.
Potter has invented what promises to be a useful new spell.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But you assigned Harry an indefinite
detention,” Hermione said weakly. &quot;Why would you do that if it
wasn't serious?&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I asked Mr. Potter to meet with
our Charms Professor after classes so that they could figure out Mr.
Potter's new hex,&quot; Minerva corrected with a smile, &quot;I never
thought I'd have to tell you about the dangers of putting too much
stock in Rumor.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sorry Professor,” Hermione said
with a blush. &quot;I thought I'd . . . sorry.&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Never apologize for asking
questions,&quot; Minerva said. &quot;Is there anything else, Ms.
Granger?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Um . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you like to join Mr. Potter's
sessions with Professor Flitwick?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright then.” Minerva jotted down
a quick note. “Will there be anything else?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just one thing, Professor,” the
girl agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Ms. Granger?” Minerva asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“May . . . is it alright if I ask a
personal question, Professor?” Hermione asked nervously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Minerva agreed. “So
long as you remember to bear in mind that being asked a question does
not necessarily mean that I will be willing to answer it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was just wondering . . .” the
girl trailed off. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” the professor prompted
gently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Who's the uniformed man in the
picture on your desk?” Hermione blurted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh, him.” Minerva giggled. “That's
my husband.”</P>
<P><BR>“Your husband?” Hermione said
dumbly. “But . . . the uniform . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My husband was a Tank Commander
during the Second World War,” Minerva said wistfully, “he looked
so dashing in his uniform.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I didn't know you married a muggle,
Professor.” The girl examined the photo, unsure how to take the
news she'd just heard. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Who said anything about a muggle?”
Minerva asked, “my husband is as pureblood as you can get without
growing extra toes.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But I thought . . .” Hermione
stammered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see,” Minerva sighed, “it's
true that the majority of the British magical community was exempted
from conscription. It's also true that the ANZAC, Canadian, and
American communities were not. And let me tell you that certainly
caused some friction, their lads called ours cowards and our lads
called theirs idiots who got involved in a muggle war. My husband
came here with the Canadian Army and to this day he refuses to set
foot on any of the home islands.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I know if he were to visit
me here he would be in Scotland.” Minerva agreed with a sniff of
distain at what she saw as the man's willful ignorance.
“Unfortunately, my husband refuses to make such distinctions.”
Minerva sighed. “Despite all that, some purebloods enlisted anyway
- exempted or not, and some of them performed very well at that, be
sure to ask Mr. Longbottom about his maternal grandfather some time,
the vast majority of the English magical community sat back and did
nothing while London burned. Makes you wonder just who they think
they owe allegiance to - if not Queen and Country. I worry
sometimes...&quot; she trailed off as old memories came to fore. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I didn't know any of this,
Professor,” Hermione confessed.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's because it's a recent and
shameful enough chapter in our history that most of those in power
would like to pretend that nothing happened,” Minerva said with
pursed lips. &quot;Will that be all, Ms. Granger?&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Professor.&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Good. Now, you will have to
excuse me, my husband is expecting me home and I hate to keep him
waiting.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;What? But I thought you said your
husband wouldn't set foot here, Professor?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;He's not. Magic makes a daily
commute from Alberta a bit easier then it would other wise be. You'd
be surprised at how adaptable humans can be,&quot; Minerva laughed.
&quot;We even found a way to make the time difference work for us.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The old woman chuckled to herself as
the young girl skipped out of her office. Ah, to be young again. She
returned home and resumed her normal routine for the next two weeks
until a note from her favorite student arrived with a request for
another meeting. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;You wished to speak with me
again, Ms. Granger?&quot; Minerva asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I need your permission to leave
school grounds, Professor,” Hermione stated in an even voice. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright, why do you wish to leave
school grounds, Ms. Granger?” Minerva asked curiously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I want to buy Harry a new watch,
Professor,” Hermione explained, “his old one broke in the
Triwizard's second task and he's been without one ever since.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What prompted this decision?”
Minerva was curious to find out what was going through the young
girl's mind and wondering if her relationship with her best friend
might not be drifting into romantic territory. Might be time to set
up another staff pool. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Christmas is coming up, Professor,”
Hermione said quickly, refusing to meet the woman's eye. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“In a couple months,” Minerva
allowed, “and?” She could feel the hint of something intriguing
hanging just out of reach. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And Harry needs a new watch,”
Hermione said firmly, trying to burry further inquiry in the subject.
“So I've decided to get him one since he apparently won't get one
for himself.&quot;  
</P>
<P><BR>“Alright,” Minerva agreed. If
the girl didn't want to talk, so be it. “Change into muggle
clothing and meet me back here in twenty minutes.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll need to visit my parents to get
some money to pay for it first, Professor,” Hermione added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That can be arranged,” Minerva
said with a smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Professor,” Hermione
said as she rushed out of the office. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The young girl returned a few minutes
later wearing a rather conservative outfit with matching sensible
shoes. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come with me, Ms. Granger,”
Minerva ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Hermione agreed,
falling into step behind her Head of House. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>They came to a halt just outside the
ward line and Minerva offered her hand to the young witch. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Now then,” Minerva said, “hold
tight and I will apparate us to your parents' house.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They're at number twelve St. James
Square,” Hermione interjected. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They moved?” Minerva asked. “Your
school records still list your address as being in the village of
Much Matchingham.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Matchingham Hall is just the weekend
house and summer house, Professor,” Hermione explained. “The
London house is at St. James Square.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” Minerva resisted the urge
to laugh at the thought of the sprawling Granger estate as being
'just' anything. “Shall we go then?”</P>
<P><BR>“Yes Professor,” Hermione
agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva kept her face impassive as her
student led her to one of the more opulent townhouses and threw open
the door. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Is mother in?&quot; Hermione
asked the first servant they ran across.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, Ms. Hermione,” the maid
replied. “Madame Granger called for the car a few minutes ago and
will be arriving shortly.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Hermione agreed, “could
you have her meet us in the library?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I can and will, Ms. Hermione,” the
maid agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione passed the time by giving her
favorite professor a quick tour of what was available in the house's
copious reference section. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course the magic section's a
bit thin,&quot; Hermione said mournfully. &quot;Perhaps . . .&quot;
she cut off when the door opened.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione,” a stately brunette that
Minerva knew to be Hermione's mother greeted them. The woman was
followed by a large grey haired man with cold predatory eyes. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mother,” Hermione said with a
smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hope you don't mind if my driver
joins our little meeting,” Hermione's mother stated. “I'm simply
lost without him around.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Not at all,” Minerva agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Now then,” she turned to her
daughter. “What's this all about?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I need to use some of my trust fund,
mum,” Hermione said with only the barest hint of nervousness. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Really?” The stately woman's
eyebrows raised a hair. “Whatever for?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I want to buy Harry a new watch,”
Hermione explained. “It will have to be more than I usually draw
for books. Father always says that you can buy quality once or junk a
hundred times,” she added after a heartbeat.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” A smile bloomed on the
woman's face. “Shall I make an appointment with our jeweler? I'm
sure he'd be happy to open something up for you this afternoon.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That won't be necessary, mum,”
Hermione said, “Professor McGonagall has already been gracious
enough to make arrangements for me.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Excellent,” the woman said with a
smile, “is there any other business we need to discuss?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“One more thing,” Minerva spoke up,
“I need you to sign a permission slip allowing Ms. Granger to
accompany me out of the country.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“To where?” The woman's eyes
flicked from her daughter to the professor. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Canada,” Minerva said, “that's
where the watchmaker, my grandfather in law, lives.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Seems like a bit of a trip,”
Hermione's mother said doubtfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Magical transportation makes it a
bit easier then would otherwise be the case,” Minerva said with a
smile. We can be there and back in just a few minutes.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course.” She signed the paper.
“Now if there is nothing else, would you do me the favor of giving
me a few minutes alone with my daughter?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Minerva agreed. Doctor
Granger's stone faced driver stood up and gently but forcefully led
her out of the room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mrs. Granger wanted me to tell you
something,” the man said in a gravelly voice. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is that?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She would like to have another
meeting with you later,” the man replied. “She would prefer it if
Miss Granger were not aware of that meeting.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Minerva agreed
quickly, “please tell Mrs. Granger that I will return after Miss
Granger and I have concluded our business.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The driver nodded and the two of them
passed the next several minutes in silence, as they waited for mother
and daughter to finish catching up.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Finished?” Minerva asked kindly
when the door opened and Hermione came out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hold on to my robes then,” Minerva
ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I didn't know that it was possible
to apparate that far,” Hermione said in wonder. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's not,” Minerva said as she
activated her portkey. “My robes are the portkey,” she finished
on the other side. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh,” Hermione said dumbly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's something I started doing when
I had children,” Minerva explained. “My robes and my hair were
the only things I could get them to hold onto.” Getting them to let
go on the other hand . . . 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione filed away that bit of
information and followed her professor down a small alley and into a
well kept shop. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Minerva?” the man said with a
grin. “Welcome.” He turned to Hermione. “And what can I do for
you, young lady?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'd like to buy a watch for my
friend Harry,” Hermione replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;What sort of watch?&quot; the man
asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It will have to be mechanical,”
Hermione mused, “other then that . . . well, father likes Patek
Philippe, or at least I think he does, the last four or five he's
bought have all been Patek Philippe.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Any model in particular?” he
asked, mentally raising the upper price limit of his recommendations.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think his current favorite has a
perpetual Calendar and a moon phase,” Hermione replied weakly, “I
never took much interest and he's got so many of them that it's hard
to keep track.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Would you like to take a look at
what I have on hand?&quot; the old man offered.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Only the ones in platinum,”
Hermione declared quickly, “father says that gold is too gaudy for
a man.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Afraid I don't have any in platinum
at the moment,” the old man confessed, “I do have a platinum case
for a pocket watch movement though.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll take a look at it,” Hermione
said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ms. Granger, does your father really
insist on platinum cases?” Minerva asked, wondering if the girl
knew how expensive it would be. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes Professor,” Hermione agreed,
“mum says that it's because he comes from new money.” Hermione
gave a impish smile. “Dad's family made their fortune in guano in
the last century and mum says that he's a bit defensive about the
whole thing,” Hermione confided. “Course, it might also be
because dad is a bit vain about jewelry and clothing.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I see.&quot; The corners of her
mouth twitched.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mum prefers to be a bit more
sensible about things,” Hermione continued. “But as she's not the
one we need to impr . . . um . . .” A panicked look appeared on
Hermione's face as she realized that she'd said too much. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ms. Granger,” Minerva sighed, “I
fear that at my age, the senses start to become dulled. Now what was
that last bit again?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;But since dad has more watches
and clothes then I'm going to trust his judgment for now,&quot;
Hermione squeaked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright, Ms. Granger,” Minerva
agreed, starting to get an idea of what was happening. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Here we are,” the old man
announced his return. He laid a small box on the table. “Take a
look.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione peered into the box with look
of intense concentration on her face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's rather big isn't it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Rather standard for a pocket watch,”
the old man replied neutrally. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where is the rest of it?” Hermione
held up the rest of the case. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The movement, crystal, and dial,
need to be picked separately.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Can you engrave the back?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” the old man agreed, “I
also have a matching chain for that.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What kind of movement?” Hermione
asked quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was thinking of using a customized
Hamilton 992b in size sixteen to match the case,” the old man said
calmly, “that's the mechanical part of the watch.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why wouldn't you just use a tempus
charm or some other spell?” Hermione shifted into knowledge
collecting mode. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“One of the major problems with the
tempus charm is that it will not keep standard time,” the old man
explained. “That leaves aside the fact that it's not accurate to
more then five minutes. Precision wasn't needed when the charm was
developed and standard time wouldn't even be considered for another
four centuries.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.” Hermione's nose wrinkled as
she processed the information.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's not to say that I didn't use
any magic,” the old man continued, “several of the parts have
been enchanted. Making this watch as waterproof, fireproof,
shockproof, scratch proof, and generally as indestructible as magic
allows. That's not to say you shouldn't be careful with it of
course.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Hermione echoed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But it should be able to survive any
accidents. Internally, the movement is self winding, cleaning,
lubricating, etc. Rather then using tritium, the dial has
illuminating charms on it that can be set so that they are only
visible to the owner or some select group of people. I could go on,
but it would take a while and it's all in the manual anyway.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wouldn't you get into trouble for
misuse of muggle artifacts?” Hermione asked intently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Doesn't apply to Canada,” the old
man laughed.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was planning to take this back to
the United Kingdom,” Hermione pointed out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I figured that when you mentioned
the statute. It's illegal to charm muggle items,” he said with a
grin, “possession of charmed muggle items is a bit of a grey area.
Let's the old families get away with a lot of shady things. Even if
it did apply to Canada . . . well, there's more than a few loopholes
in that law.” Overseas trade being lucrative enough to encourage a
very close reading of the laws in question. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Doesn't apply to things made by
members of a magical society for one,&quot; the old man replied,
&quot;which covers everything that's got an enchantment. Aside from
that, they only apply the statute to any tech more modern then the
last war . . . er . . . the one my boy went to I mean.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They don't?” Hermione asked in
shock, a whole new world of research had just opened to her. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;You never wondered about the
Hogwarts express, the Knight Bus, or the Wizard Wireless?&quot; he
asked with a grin.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But . . . but, there's nothing in
the library . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Train is run by a Canadian crew,
predominately Canadian I should say. Knight Bus has an American
mechanic that makes the trip across the pond every now and again, and
the Wizard Wireless has maintenance people from any number of
places.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We use some technology,” Minerva
interjected, “but we lack the skills to reproduce or maintain it
for the most part. Most purebloods refuse to have anything to do with
it and look down on anyone who has the necessary skills.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;That's why there are no books in
the library?&quot; Hermione asked in a small voice.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's why,” Minerva agreed, “the
Board didn't think it appropriate to waste resources on something so
common and frivolous . . . I can help you acquire some books on the
subject if you like.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you Professor, that would be
wonderful,” Hermione gushed. “And . . . um . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it Ms. Granger?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you think that you could take
Harry out to get some new clothes?” Hermione asked. “It'd be best
if you knew someone, Professor, but I could make an appointment with
my father's tailor on Bond street if you like.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why don't we discuss that later,”
Minerva suggested. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright, Professor,” Hermione
agreed.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva saw her charge safely back in
the castle before heading to her meeting with the young girl's
mother. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for taking the time to
meet with me Professor McGonagall,” Hermione's mother began, “I
have some concerns that I was hoping you could address.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I will do my best, Mrs. Granger,&quot;
Minerva said calmly.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“First of all, I was wondering why
your school chose not to inform us of all that has happened.” The
woman's eyes were cold. “Or about how close we came to losing our
daughter.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I . . .” Minerva was acutely aware
of the woman's 'driver' taking a position behind her. “Wait, you
weren't informed?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No,” the woman said flatly, her
voice like a gunshot. “We weren't.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But the charms should have . . .”
Minerva trailed off. “Did you put in any wards?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We have not,” the woman replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then . . . I suppose it could be due
to the fact that you have two residences,” Minerva said slowly, “or
. . . well, any number of things I suppose. I'm afraid we're speaking
outside my area of expertise. I will have to get back to you with an
answer.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” she agreed. She gave her
driver a meaningful look, causing him to take a step back and assume
a more neutral position. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just like that?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Just like that,&quot; Hermione's
mother agreed, &quot;I pride myself on being able to judge people and
I'm sure that now that you know about the problem you'll insure it
doesn't crop up again, but it has brought another matter to light
which will be a bit more difficult to deal with.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What matter?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My husband and I are no longer
confident that the administration will act in our daughter's best
interests,” she explained.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ms. Granger will be devastated to
hear that you're pulling her out of Hogwarts,” Minerva pointed out.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;We haven't decided to pull her
out yet,&quot; the woman stated. &quot;We are strongly considering
the possibility that we may have to at some future date. I would ask
that you take a closer interest in her well being. Take that as a
personal request if you will.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; Minerva agreed.
The old woman was willing to do almost anything to keep her star
pupil. &quot;A question, if I may.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If the school failed to notify you,
then how did you find out?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“One of my husband's old school
friends is classmate of the father of another of your students,”
the woman explained. “Now that we have the unpleasantness out of
the way, please call me Anne.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Minerva,” McGonagall replied
automatically. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Minerva, then.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“One thing has been bothering me,”
McGonagall began. “I was hoping that you could enlighten me.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was wondering if you knew why
Hermione suddenly became so interested in Mr. Potter's appearance?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;At a guess, it's because Hermione
has been mentioning so much in her letters that we extended an
invitation for him to join us this winter.&quot; The woman smiled.
&quot;We saw him at a distance a few years ago when we were putting
Hermione on the train, my husband pronounced him scruffy.” Her
smile widened. “I'm sure you've noticed the fact that my daughter
is prone to over thinking things.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, I have noticed that,” Minerva
said dryly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She is likely going to bother the
poor boy about his appearance until after we meet,” Anne giggled.
She made a 'come here' motion to her driver who handed Minerva a
large envelope. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's this?” Minerva asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;A letter of credit from the
goblins and an ebony card,&quot; Anne replied. &quot;Please use it to
make young Harry presentable and for any projects Hermione decides to
take on.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva's eyes bulged at the amount on
the Gringotts note. &quot;This is . . .&quot; she choked, unable to
bring herself to verbalize the number.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't hesitate to call if you need
more,” Anne added cheerfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I . . .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“With that out of the way.” She
leaned forward with an eager smile. “Do you have any embarrassing
stories to share about my daughter that I could persuade you to pass
on?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione had just settled down to
breakfast when a large owl dumped a rectangular package on her lap.
Curiously, the girl opened it and was delighted to find a basic
primer on technomagic.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wa'd'yu'ga'der?” Ron asked between
bites. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a book on mixing magic and
simple technology,” Hermione replied absently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Did you know that the reason we
don't see any Wireless sets around the castle is because the wards
interfere with the signal?” Hermione asked with shining eyes. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Nope,&quot; Ron replied. He
looked at her and then looked down at his breakfast. The boy was in a
quandary. If he stayed then he'd be the unwilling recipient of a
lesson on whatever the girl's latest obsession was, but if he left he
wouldn't get breakfast.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>'Damn it, think Ron think!'</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>His eyes lit up as he got an idea.
&quot;Look at the time,&quot; Ron said quickly. He seized two large
slabs of bread and made a sandwich out of everything within arms
reach. &quot;Later Hermione.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bye Ron,” Hermione said
automatically. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva sat in her office with a frown
on her face. Now what was the name of that insane house elf that was
stalking young Mister Potter again? Started with a 'D' didn't it?
Dinky . . . Drippy . . . Doodle . . .</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Dobby?&quot; Minerva ventured.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Dobby is here and you is calling
Dobby, Ms. Professor Kitty?&quot; the deranged house elf said
eagerly.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I need you to get me Mr. Potter's
measurements,” Minerva began. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Dobby already has them,” the house
elf said in excitement, “Dobby likes to remeasure Mister Harry
Potter sir every night while Dobby is watching Mister Harry Potter
sir sleep.” In another part of the castle, Harry felt a chill go up
his spine. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Excellent,” Minerva said dully,
perhaps it would be best to just pretend she hadn't heard that last
bit. “Now if you wouldn't mind sharing them with me?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Dobby is happy to help the great
Harry Potter sir's Ms. Professor Kitty,” the house elf agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva looked at the paper.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Fourteen centimeters?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Professor Kitty.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;That's an invasion of Mr.
Potter's privacy. Stop measuring that.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The elf looked downcast. &quot;Yes,
Professor Kitty.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione looked up from her book in
concern as Harry shivered again. Knowing his luck, Hermione was half
convinced that the poor boy had contracted some rare tropical
disease.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Are you feeling alright Harry?”
Hermione asked in concern. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm just a bit tired, I'll be
fine,&quot; Harry assured her. &quot;We've got History first. I'll
use that time to catch up on my sleep.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Um . . .” Concern warred with
outrage to see who would get to make the response. “Alright Harry.”
It wasn't like she was in a position to throw too many stones since
she had already decided to read her new book during the lesson. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione's father walked into his home
and cheerfully kissed his wife, hands dropping to do  something that
caused her to emit a girlish squeak. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Welcome home, Philip,” her mother
said happily. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;The staff tells me that Hermione
decided to drop by?&quot; he said by way of greeting. Shame he hadn't
been able to see her while she was in. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She wanted to make a withdrawal from
her trust fund,” Anne explained. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Whatever for?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“To purchase a new watch for her
friend Harry,” the woman said with a grin. “It seems that she's
gotten the idea that you won't like him if he isn't a sharp dresser.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where did she get a silly idea like
that?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You said he was scruffy once,”
Anne replied. “Apparently, that's enough to get her obsessing about
the matter.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I told her that I would be delighted
to meet the boy,” he protested. “I also told her that his
economic status didn't bother me in the slightest.” Knowing his
daughter, it was unlikely in the extreme that the boy had any idea
how wealthy they were. He supposed that was one way of keeping the
gold diggers away.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She ignored all that of course,”
his wife said with a shrug, “I gave her professor enough so that
the boy will match even your standards.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just because I like to look my
best-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Doesn't mean that you're gay,” she
giggled. “Even though my sisters and friends all thought . . .
still think that you are.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Fashion is one thing that I
refuse to argue with you,&quot; he sniffed, &quot;philistine.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Dandy,&quot; she growled, a fire
lighting in her eyes.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Uncultured harridan,&quot; he
sneered leaning towards her.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Foppish boor,&quot; she accused,
as he leaned in, wrapping his arms around her.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Do you think the boy would like
to go riding?&quot; he asked suddenly.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot; she asked dully.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Polo, the hunt club, that sort of
thing,&quot; he explained. &quot;Hermione may be indifferent but one
of her letters mentioned that he was a keen rider.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of brooms,” she pointed out, “not
horses.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Still . . . he might like some
variety.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“True,” she agreed, “it couldn't
hurt. Might be a good idea to get him some lessons first, ease into
things.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” he agreed. “Now
where were we?” He leaned in close. “Uncultured harridan.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You already used that one,” she
moaned, “you . . . you . . . ohhhhh.”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva was unsurprised to find
Hermione waiting outside the transfiguration classroom after the last
class for the day.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What can I do for you Ms. Granger?”
Minerva asked with a fond smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Professor, may I . . . I mean, do
you think it would be possible if I . . . um . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;May I go down to the tracks and
inspect the Hogwarts Express?&quot; Hermione blurted out.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“There's no rule against it,”
Minerva replied, “though you may wish to speak with Ms. Lovegood
before planning any trips.”</P>
<P><BR>“Why Professor?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I believe that she enjoys watching
them perform maintenance,” Minerva said. “It therefore stands to
reason that she would know more about how to go about it then I
would.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Professor,” Hermione
said in excitement before bolting down the hall to find her odd
friend. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna was engaged in a staring contest
with one of the portraits when Hermione found her. As it was one of
the few non-magical portraits in the castle, there was no telling how
long the girl had been at it. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna,” Hermione said Hesitantly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmm?” Luna broke eye contact. “Oh
darn. What is it, Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was hoping that you would be
willing to introduce me to the crew of the Hogwarts Express,”
Hermione said quickly, “Professor McGonagall said you liked to
watch them maintain the train.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, Hermione,” Luna said in
delight, “come on.” She grabbed the older girl by the hand and
began leading her forcefully out of the castle. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right now?” Hermione asked weakly.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm sure they're doing something
Interesting at the moment,” Luna agreed. &quot;They usually are.&quot;
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You like trains a lot then?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They're so fascinating,” Luna
babbled as the two girls walked down to the engine shed that held the
Hogwarts Express when it was not in use. “I'm fairly sure that
Minister Fudge is planning to use his imprisoned . . .” It was at
this point that Hermione tuned Luna out.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why look who's come to visit again
boys,” a man in grease stained overalls called out. “How are you
doing today Ms. Lovegood?”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Very well thank you,” Luna said
politely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see you've brought a friend.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Yes,” Luna agreed, “this is
Hermione. She's a year ahead of me at Hogwarts.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Pleasure to meet you Hermione,&quot;
the man said kindly, &quot;there are some doughnuts in the break
room. Why don't you go get one for yourself and another for your
friend?&quot; he suggested to Luna.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I normally wouldn't,” Luna said
with a dreamy smile. “But the Humdingers here should keep the
rotfangs away.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wonderful,” he said with a smile.
The large man waited until Luna was out of earshot before turning to
Hermione. “Can I speak with you for a bit?” The man in the grease
stained overalls asked Hermione. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Hermione agreed, “what
is it?”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“That girl you came in with,” he
began, “we're not sure why she likes to come here.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Hermione agreed, unsure
of where the conversation was heading. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It could be that she grew up around
a mechanical printing press and sees our shop as a little bit of home
thanks to the similar sights, sounds, and smells,” the burly
Engineer said thoughtfully. “Could also be because we don't put up
with the sort of behavior that the staff at the castle finds
acceptable,” his voice hardened, “understand?”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna really is my friend,”
Hermione protested. “We might argue sometimes but . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What friends don't,” the man
agreed, all smiles and good cheer again. “Good to see she has some
friend her own age.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione gave a shy nod, unsure of how
to take that bit of wisdom. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione is interested in the
Engines,” Luna announced as she burst back into the room. The girl
was holding a half eaten doughnut in one hand and an untouched
doughnut in the other. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;You are huh?&quot; he asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She is,” Luna confirmed as she
handed the other girl her share of the pastry haul.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well, we've got two Clan Class
engines that don't get a whole lot of work.” He waved to his left.
“But what people tend to think of as the Hogwarts Express is one of
our Black Fives. That's a LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 Locomotive.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you mean one of?” Hermione
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Never put all your eggs in one
basket,” he advised, “there's also the fact that we'd never be
able to haul all the cargo we do with just one Engine.” He laughed.
“Our passenger service isn't all we do you know, also bring in just
about everything the castle needs to stay running.” He turned and
began walking to the closest locomotive. “This way.” He led the
girls to one of the engines. “This particular one was built in
nineteen thirty six by Armstrong Whitworth. It's sixty three feet,
seven and three quarters inches long. Weighs seventy three long tons.
Uses a Walschaerts valve gear as opposed to a Stephenson Valve Gear.
Uh . . . anything else you'd like to know?”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'd like to know what all of that
means,” Hermione said, eyes shining with excitement. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're welcome to poke through our
library if you like,” he said with a shrug. A grin appeared when he
noticed the girl's reaction. “And to ask as many questions as you
like.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hermione said
with sparkling eyes. The thought of being granted access to a
previously unknown source of reading material being almost too much
for the girl. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would it be possible to go on a trip
with you some time?” Luna asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That'd be up to your Professor,”
he said easily. “Fore you go asking her I'd like to caution you
that it's a filthy job and that you'll be pitch black and covered in
soot by the end of the day if you come along.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Flitwick stared down at his fused hands
with a look of joy on his face. It had taken quit a bit of effort but
they'd finally managed to replicate the boy's accident. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wonderful, Harry!” the diminutive
Charms Professor shouted. “Absolutely brilliant!” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I did it,” Harry mumbled in shock.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Indeed you did,” the Professor
agreed. “Do you think you could do it again?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm pretty sure I could,” Harry
agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Excellent.” The Professor looked
down at his hands. “Do you think you could undo it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Maybe,” Harry said uncertainly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Well . . . I dare say that Poppy
will be able to undo faster now that she's done it once before, so
give it a shot. What's the worst that could happen?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The Engineer watched as the two girls
examined every visible part of the locomotive. It did his heart good
to see a couple of the Brits take an interest in their heritage and
it would be nice to think that they might some day be able to do
their own maintenance.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Fat chance of that,&quot; he
muttered to himself. Either the girls would lose interest or they'd
emmigrate to one of the more tolerant nations.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The United Kingdom had a bigger problem
then their home grown terrorists, their best and their brightest grew
up into a society that stifled innovation, that smothered any attempt
to change the world for the better, was it any wonder that so many
had chosen to go on to greener pastures?</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Filius wilted under the Healer's glare.
It seemed the school nurse was much less enthused about young Mister
Potter's feat of magic than he was. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mr. Potter was successful,” he
ventured. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So it seems,” Poppy agreed flatly.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He was able to get my hands
partially undone,” he added hesitantly, eyes flicking to
interlocking bone spikes now growing out of his mostly separated
knuckles. &quot;I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that it's quite
possible that his new spell can be adapted to painlessly regrow
missing bones.&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do tell.” You could cut glass with
her voice. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Something tells me that you're not
too pleased with what happened,” Filius observed, his voice raising
an octave. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Why ever would you think that I
was displeased with the fact that you were acting as a test dummy for
spell experimentation? &quot; she asked sweetly. &quot;Or that you
chose to have Mr. Potter attempt a counter curse, rather then coming
straight to the Hospital wing to have things dealt with by
professionals.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;It was all Albus's idea!&quot;
Filius squealed, throwing the Headmaster under the bus. &quot;I
didn't want to do it, but he made me.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He paused to consider something,
wouldn't hurt and it might score a few points. &quot;Harry didn't
want to do it either but Albus made us both, he's a very very bad
man.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” she agreed. <BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot; he asked in shock.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” she repeated herself, “I
suppose I can accept that explanation.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good, I-” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” he asked weakly, preparing
himself for the worst. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think it's likely that Albus might
try these sorts of shenanigans again in the future,” she stated
calmly. “I think it would be best for Mr. Potter to spend a few
nights a week in the Hospital wing learning about emergency healing.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;It'll also give you a chance to
work on that new medical charm with him,” he added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;It will, won't it?&quot; Poppy
agreed with mock innocence. &quot;Why, I hadn't even considered
that.&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I see.&quot; Wasn't like he owed
the kid anything, or at least not enough to go against the school
nurse. “Deal.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pleasure doing business with you
Filius.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Likewise, Poppy.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Hermione and Luna had
submerged themselves in the shop's small library of technical manuals
and trade publications.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Did you know that American
Locomotives are too large for British tracks?” Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I did not,” Luna replied, “did
you know that there were several unsuccessful attempts to use
salamanders as heat generators in the firebox?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Pass me that one when you're done
with it,&quot; Hermione requested excitedly.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Of course Hermione,&quot; Luna
happily agreed, thinking how nice it was so nice to finally have a
friend who shared a common interest with her.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry and Professor Flitwick squared
off in the latter's classroom. After a bow, both men drew their wands
with a flourish.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ready Harry?” Flitwick asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think so sir,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay,” the old man said with a
grin, “on three. One . . . two . . . three.” The old man cast a
spell at Harry and blocked the boy's own spell. “Nice,” the old
man said with a grin, “but not nice enough.” His grin deepened as
Harry slumped to the ground.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What happened?” Harry asked
dumbly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Age, experience, and treachery won
again,” the diminutive charms professor explained. “Care to try
again?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Harry agreed gamely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright, stand up,” Flitwick
instructed. The two of them faced each other. “Stretch.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry complied, he also cast a couple
small spells. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What were those?” Flitwick asked
curiously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Medical charms,” Harry said, “I
learned them from Madame Pomfrey.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They don't look like healing
charms?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They're not, Professor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right then, holster your wand and
bow.” Flitwick's smile turned devious. “On three. One . . . two.”
He cast a hex at the boy and was shocked to his core that the boy had
already moved out of the way, his shock was so profound that Harry's
returning hexes ended the fight. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry's grin looked ready to split his
face as he undid the spells he cast on his Professor.<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Nice reflexes,&quot; Flitwick
complimented.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I had a bit of help,” Harry said
smugly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I've got a tell?&quot; the former
dueling champ asked in dismay.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I cheated,” Harry explained. “The
medical charm I cast allowed me to monitor your heart rate.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It sped up a bit before I cast
didn't it?” Flitwick laughed. “Well done!”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I didn't expect it to work so well,”
Harry admitted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well it did,” Flitwick said
gamely. “Would you mind undoing the hex you used on my hands?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What hex?” Harry asked dumbly. 
</P>
<P><BR>“The one you used to transfigure
the bones in my hand to remove the joints and . . . that was another
accident wasn't it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Harry admitted
sheepishly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Well . . . I dare say that
Minerva will enjoy the opportunity of figuring it out with you,&quot;
Flitwick said firmly, deciding that he'd pressed his luck with the
school healer enough for this quarter.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I guess so,” Harry agreed glumly.
He wasn't sure how he'd get anything done with another extra class
added to his schedule. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The Engineer got a bit worried when the
girls went quiet, something that was rarely a good thing when
children were playing, and elected to investigate. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Everything alright?” he asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We're just putting the finishing
touches on our design,” Hermione said proudly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mind if I take a look?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Go ahead,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmmm.”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is something the matter?” Luna
inquired. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why don't we turn out a model of
this so we can find out?” the Engineer suggested. “Shouldn't take
more then a couple hours,” he added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And it'll give us a chance to see
how all the tools work,” Hermione enthused, “thank you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Happy to help,” the old man said
with a grin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The grin that bloomed on Professor
McGonagall's face after she heard what had happened with the bones in
the Charms Master's hand tripped every warning instinct that Harry
possessed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;It isn't supposed to work like
that,&quot; Minerva said cheerfully, &quot;looks as if we have a lot
of work to do before we'll be able to figure this out, 'eh Mr.
Potter.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Professor,&quot; Harry
dolefully agreed.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm glad you're as excited about it
as I am.” Minerva ignored Harry's downcast look. “Come along
then, Mr. Potter, the sooner we get started, the sooner we can finish
the other errands on our list.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Other errands?” Harry said in
confusion. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We need to get you some new clothing
to make you presentable,” Minerva explained.  'For Ms. Granger's
parents, the Charms Conference, and hopefully the Transfiguration
Trade Show.' She thought to herself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>They set up their model and the
Engineer hustled the two girls behind a large steel barricade. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Must we be so far back?” Hermione
asked with an uncharacteristically petulant look on her face.  She
really wanted to observe the test of the new steam engine up close. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Safety first,” the Engineer said
cheerfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Fine,” Hermione gave her unhappy
assent, “but I want to be able to give it a closer inspection the
next time we fire it so that I can-” &lt;BOOOOM!&gt; Her jaw
dropped in shock as the engine exploded, scattering pieces over a
large portion of the field. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh, that was ever so much fun.”
Luna clapped her hands. “May we pretty please do it again?” She
batted her eyes lashes at the Engineer. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I dare say that it'll happen again,”
the old man laughed. He turned to Hermione. “That, young lady, is
why we stay back when we test out new things.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But . . . but . . . but what
happened?” Hermione stammered. She'd been so sure that their design
was perfect, the thought that such a catastrophic failure could occur
had never crossed her mind. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You forgot to put in a safety
valve,” he explained gently. “Bet it's one thing you'll never
forget again 'eh?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Hermione agreed weakly.
“But I was so sure . . .”</P>
<P><BR>“You two did a marvelous job,”
the engineer assured her. “Just left out a few things.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Which you noticed right away,&quot;
Hermione noted aloud.</P>
<P><BR>“I have been doing this longer
then either of you have been alive,” he said a trifle smugly. 
“Longer than both of you together have been alive. Come on, we'll
have some lunch and continue the lesson inside.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;But you could have pointed it out
and then we wouldn't have blown this one up,&quot; she protested.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I could have,&quot; the
engineer agreed affably. &quot;But then you would be more likely to
make the same mistake again. This way you'll never forget about the
safety valve or indeed anything with the word safety attached to it
while building the next one.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;We learn more from our failures
than from our successes,&quot; she quoted from memory, remembering
one of her mother's lectures.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;That and building the same thing
repeatedly,&quot; the old man added. He grinned, it was always fun to
bring a couple aspiring Engineers into the fold.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;What mistake makes the prettiest
explosion?&quot; Luna inquired with a wide grin.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Lun...&quot; Hermione's voice
trailed off as she changed her mind about whatever she had been about
to say, &quot;Let's save that for when we know we've bolloxed up
something beyond repair. I'm sure we'll have enough explosions
without intentionally causing them.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;That you will,&quot; the engineer
said cheerfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He led the girls to the shed's small
kitchen area and pulled a largish pot off one of the shelves. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you know what this is?” he held
out an odd looking pot. 
</P>
<P><BR>“It's a pressure cooker,”
Hermione replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yep,” the old man agreed, “and
do you know what this thing on top is?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Safety valve?” Hermione said
weakly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yep, pressure gets too high and this
bleeds off a bit of steam which in turn lowers the pressure.” He
scratched his chin thoughtfully. “I'm telling you this so you don't
feel too bad, guy that invented these things forgot the safety valve
too.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I won't in the future,” Hermione
said in a subdued tone. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I know ye won't,” he agreed. “My
experience has shown me that people don't tend to forget practical
lessons. Now then, this lesson isn't so much bout steam as it is bout
cooking.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Cooking?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You don't think we eat rocks do
you?” the old Engineer laughed. “Food is important for morale.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Can we blow that up too?” Luna
asked hopefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not unless we overfill it or block
the safety valve,” he replied, “which you are not going to do.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Awwww.” Luna pouted, ramping up
her cuteness factor by at least a factor of ten. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“None of that,” he admonished. “So
then, do either of you know how to cook?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;We were taught how to do potions
by Professor Snape,&quot; Hermione offered.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;That's a no then,&quot; he
translated with a smile. &quot;Wonderful.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Wonderful?&quot; Hermione echoed,
wondering why he seemed so happy about that fact. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yep,” he agreed. “We've got
lessons in pressure and in cooking. Multitasking.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We're also making lunch for  the
crew,” Luna pointed out. “Three things at once.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Right you are, girl.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry nervously followed his Head of
House into a rather fancy looking haberdasher in an unfamiliar
magical district.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Where are we, Professor?&quot;
Harry asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;London,&quot; Minerva replied.
&quot;Ontario,&quot; she added upon seeing his skeptical look.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.” Harry took a few moments to
absorb the fact that he'd just made his first trip abroad. “Don't I
need permission to leave the country?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Normally yes,” Minerva agreed.
“The fact that you're an orphan gives me a certain amount of . . .
leeway, shall we say.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Why didn't you give me permission
to visit Hogsmead in third year?&quot; Harry asked curiously.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It was thought that you had a
notorious killer after you,” Minerva said reasonably. She decided
to refrain from mentioning  the fact that Albus had forbidden it.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh. I understand, Professor,&quot;
Harry said.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Now then,” Minerva's raised her
voice, “Andy . . . Andy, are you here?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Aunt Minerva?&quot; a woman's
voice replied from the back.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Victoria?” Minerva said in
surprise. “What are you doing here?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Dad wanted to spend the day with the
grandkids and I wanted some freedom,” the girl replied. “Who's
this?” She focused on Harry. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“One of my students,” Minerva
replied. “He needs a new wardrobe so I brought him here.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Magical or mundane?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The whole thing.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just let me grab the tape.” The
woman dashed into the back. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;You know her, Professor?&quot;
Harry whispered. The eager gleam that had lit the woman's eyes did
not inspire confidence. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She's my niece,” Minerva replied.
“Her father is one of my brothers in law.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione would never have admitted it,
but she was more then a bit nervous to see the mens' reactions as
they tried the soup. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How is it?” Luna asked with her
seemingly endless cheer. A slight intake of breath was the only
outward sign that she was anxious about the answer. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Great,” one of the firemen
replied. “Better than usual anyway.” 
</P>
<P><BR>&quot;Yay!&quot; Luna cheered. &quot;You
hear that, Hermione?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes Luna,&quot; Hermione agreed
with a smile.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>None of the men saw fit to mention that
they'd have cheerfully ladled spoons full of bunker oil into their
mouths if it would have made the two young girls happy. They had
become quite fond of the two children in the short time that they'd
started hanging around the shop. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva took a few moments to examine
her student in the latest outfit that her niece had forced upon the
poor boy. What had started as a short trip to buy a couple suits and
a few casual outfits had quickly turned into a fashion show. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How do you feel Mr. Potter?”
Minerva asked carefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A bit strange to be wearing a great
kilt Professor,” Harry replied with a doubtful look on his face.
“Are you sure I'm going to need one of these?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No,” Minerva replied. “I'm
equally sure that my niece will not allow you to leave without it.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;What should we dress him in
next?&quot; the aforementioned woman asked gleefully. &quot;How about
a tuxedo, what do you think Aunt Minnie?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;At least the air on my bits feels
nice,&quot; Harry muttered too quiet for anyone, but a cat animagus
to hear.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva managed to stifle her laughter,
but only just.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ginny approached her slightly older
brother with a worried expression on her face. She hadn't seen him in
the company of the other members of the trio for quite some time,
come to think of it, she hadn't seen any of the members of the so
called 'golden trio' spend any time with each other for at least a
week and she was worried about how her brother might be holding up. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Got a minute, Ron?&quot; she
asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;What's up, Ginny?&quot; Ron
asked. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You tell me,” Ginny sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you mean?” Ron asked with
a look of befuddlement on his face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You, Harry, and Hermione haven't
been spending much time together lately,” Ginny explained, “I was
worried.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Hermione's become obsessed with
something besides 'Hogwarts a History' and Harry keeps fumbling his
casting and accidentally inventing new spells,&quot; Ron said with a
grin. “Meaning he has to go to extra classes with the Professors.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh . . . so, nothing's wrong then?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nope,” Ron said cheerfully. “Not
unless you count the new wart on my second toe.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh. So . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Care for a game of chess?” Ginny
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're on,” Ron agreed. “I'll
even spot you a bishop.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hah! A queen,” Ginny countered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You must be dreaming,” Ron
laughed. “How about a knight and four pawns.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Now who's dreaming?” Ginny
giggled. “How long has it been since we played a game?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not long enough to forget that
you're not nearly as bad as you like to pretend you are,” Ron
retorted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva was beginning to get impatient.
Harry had been in the changing room for several minutes and showed no
sign of coming out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mr. Potter,” she prompted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm not coming out!” Harry said
stubbornly. “Just give me my clothes and-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What did she give you?” Minerva
sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just some swim wear,” her niece
said innocently. She flicked her wand and the changing room door
popped open. “Oops,” she said insincerely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry's eyes bulged when he saw that
his near nakedness was being observed by the two older women. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Akkkk,” he choked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You thought that was appropriate?”
Minerva asked dryly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Speedos are in,” her niece said
with a shrug. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The Engineer watched with a proud grin
as the two girls went back to redesign their sketches to include
safety valves, with a satisfied smile on his face. That was one
catastrophic error down, several dozen more to go.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Ready to build another model
then?&quot; he asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'd like to try out this new design
for a safety first,” Luna said brightly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Want to make something else explode,
do you? he laughed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No,” Luna said quickly, “I wish
to see if it works.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Win, win situation then,” he
agreed. “It works, it works. It doesn't . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Boom!” Luna giggled, throwing her
arms out to mimic her new favorite thing in the world. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>They threw together another quick model
and set it up to watch the results. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna was not disappointed as this model
also chose to explode and scatter parts of itself over a large area. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What happened?” Hermione asked in
confusion. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Can you tell us Luna?” the
Engineer asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna ignored the question in favor of
giggling and clapping.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna . . .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmm?” Luna looked over. “To be
honest, I haven't the faintest. If my calculations were correct, it
should have worked.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And it would have if you'd make
these small changes.” He sketched out a quick diagram. “Do you
see.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“I believe so,” Luna agreed,
“thank you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry looked at the large pile of
clothing with a sense of dawning horror. There was no way . . . she
couldn't expect him to . . . why did the universe always seem like it
was conspiring against him? 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do I really need all of that,
Professor?” he whispered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you want to be the one to tell
her that you don't?” Minerva asked mildly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, Professor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I thought not,” Minerva said with
a grin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where am I going to put it all?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I suppose we could pick you up a
charmed valise before we head back to Hogwarts,” Minerva mused.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“More shopping?” Harry asked in
dismay. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just a bit,” Minerva agreed
sympathetically. “Buck up, Mr. Potter, Gryffindors don't shrink
away from unpleasantness.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Harry agreed
grumbly. This was almost worse than fighting Voldemort. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna went over one of the conversations
she'd had with Hermione. She wasn't sure but there was something
about it that was bothering her.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Luna looked over at
her friend. &quot;Hermione?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it Luna?” Hermione looked
up from the drafting table. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You mentioned that you were planning
to have Harry spend a portion of the winter holiday with you,” Luna
said with a grin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uh huh,” Hermione agreed, “why?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Does Harry know?” Luna asked. “I
ask because I don't recall you telling me that you asked him over,
just that you were planning to.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Oh bugger,&quot; Hermione moaned.
The girl had a stricken look on her face. &quot;What if he already
has plans?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Did he tell you he had any?” Luna
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No,” Hermione admitted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Has he ever had any plans before?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well no, but-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then I wouldn't worry about it,”
Luna said cheerfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But this year might be different,”
Hermione cried. “I can't believe I forgot.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just be sure to ask him when he gets
back,” Luna said soothingly. “Everything will be fine Hermione.”
</P>
<P><BR>“Thank you, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What are friends for, Hermione.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you like to spend some time at
my house over the holiday?” Hermione asked. “It's fine if you'd
rather spend time with your father,” Hermione added quickly, “I
just thought . . .”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“That would be wonderful,” Luna
squealed, pulling the larger girl into a hug. “Thank you.” It was
so nice to finally have friends. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione ambushed Harry the moment he
walked into the Gryffindor common room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry,” Hermione squeaked. “Would
you like to visit my house during winter holiday?”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is it alright with your parents?”
Harry asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It was their idea.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Harry agreed, “thank
you.” It sounded much better than spending his time off in a drafty
castle in the middle of a Scottish winter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva was surprised, nay shocked to
find the Headmaster waiting for her when she got back to her office. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;May I have a moment, Minerva?&quot;
the old man asked without his usual cheerfulness.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, Albus?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hear that you gave Ms. Granger
permission to invite Harry to her house over the winter holiday,”
Albus began. “Is this true?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What if it is?” Minerva
challenged. “It's well within my rights to grant permission as his
head of house.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just because you can do something,
doesn't mean that you should.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A lesson that you would do well to
learn yourself,” Minerva snipped. “It isn't healthy for children
their age to live the sort of life that you've chosen to inflict on
poor Mr. Potter.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Minerva, listen to reason. You must
understand that-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;No you must understand,&quot;
Minerva interrupted. &quot;You must understand that I am not content
to sit idly by while you trample my responsibilities in your
obsession with Mr. Potter.. I allowed you to place him with those
dreadful muggles, I allowed you to keep him confined to the castle, I
said nothing when you kept sending him back to those horrible people,
I aided you in so many ways that I have no doubt that James and Lily
would have hexed me into oblivion if they'd have lived to see what we
did to their child. No more Albus, I will not sit by and allow these
transgressions to continue any longer.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Then it seems that we no longer
have anything to say to each other on this matter,&quot; Albus said
sadly when he realized that he really couldn't justify his actions as
being what was best for the boy, even to himself. &quot;Good evening,
Minerva.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good evening, Headmaster.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione walked down to the engine shed
after classes to find Luna already in the shops' small library,
immersed in a large book. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good afternoon, Luna.” Hermione
said politely as she examined the stack to determine which book to
take down for herself.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmm?” Luna looked up with a cute
expression of bewilderment on her face. “Hermione, come look at
this.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, Luna?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a sterling engine,” Luna
replied, her face alight with excitement. “They were invented to be
a safer alternative to steam engines.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not very efficient thought,”
Hermione mused. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not the ones they've built so far,”
Luna agreed. “But it says here that they're capable of being almost
perfectly efficient in theory.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Hermione mumbled
thoughtfully. “How are we going to improve it to that point?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;You mustn't forget the fact that
we are witches, Hermione,&quot; Luna pointed out. &quot;Meaning we
have access to tools and techniques the muggles do not.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;True,&quot; Hermione agreed with
a slowly growing smile. &quot;Great Idea, Luna. Who knows what we can
come up with using solid muggle theory and magical tools?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>“Thank you, Hermione.”

<P>Anne Granger was going over the latest
bit of correspondence she'd received from Minerva when the door to
the study opened to admit her husband. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;How was your day, Philip?&quot;
Hermione's mother asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Fairly productive,” he replied.
“Bought a new string of polo ponies.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh?” Anne exclaimed. “Whatever
for?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;For Harry's use when he visits,&quot;
Philip replied. &quot;Not a one a day under eight years old so they
all know more about the game than most of the players.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Tack?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Put an order in yesterday,” he
said proudly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Exactly the sort of behavior I
expect to see from the decadent commercial class,” she sneered.
&quot;How many houses could be built with even a fraction of the
funds you chose to waste on frivolities?&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Better a decadent capitalist then a
spoiled blue-blood that's never been a productive member of society,
especially one that's chosen to glorify the noble underclass and
their so called struggler against their employers,” he growled
back. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uncultured pig,” she sighed as she
leaned into his embrace. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pampered lay-about,” he growled as
he tightened his grip. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Unlettered baboon.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So how was your day?” Philip asked
in a normal voice. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I had a particularly difficult
extraction that I would be delighted to discuss later,” she huffed.
“You know I hate it when you break the mood like that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I know it gets you worked up,” he
agreed with a grin. “But I suppose one can not expect too much from
a feckless aristo.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's a new one,” she moaned in
appreciation, “you . . . ohhh yesssssss.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna and Hermione were both getting
more and more frustrated as their search of the shops' small library
failed to produce much that they'd be able to use in their new engine
project. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;It's a shame that we're not in
the colonies,&quot; Luna sighed. &quot;Or that the biker didn't
survive the war.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Hermione agreed. “Wait,
what biker?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Father used to tell me stories about
a man with a flying motorbike that fought Death Eaters.” Luna
explained. “He disappeared at the end of the war so father thinks
that he must have been killed because a man like him would never have
allowed the Ministry to enslave-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna,” Hermione interrupted the
girl's tale. She was not in the mood to put up with any of her
friend's crazy tales at the moment. “Wait, did you say flying
motorbike? You did, didn't you?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I believe I did, Hermione.” Luna
paused. “But perhaps I didn't.” She scratched her chin. &quot;I
suppose either is possible.&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come on.” Hermione grabbed the
other girl by the wrist and began dragging her towards the castle.
“We need to talk to someone.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We do? Alright, if you say so,
Hermione.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>It had to be one of the most awkward
staff meeting that Albus Dumbledore had ever been in, let alone
chaired. Half his staff was glaring at the other half of his staff
and while it was far from unusual for them to swap glares with his
potions master, they usually had much better relations with each
other. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Look at that,&quot; he said
suddenly. It took everything the Headmaster had not to wilt when the
glares shifted to him. &quot;I'm afraid I must be going to handle
something vitally important at the Ministry,&quot; he said suddenly.
&quot;Minerva, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to ask you to direct
the rest of the meeting.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, Headmaster.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Goodbye all,” Dumbledore said as
he rushed out of the room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well then,” Minerva said after her
superior had left the room. “I think it's time we got down to
business?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I have better things to do then to
sit here with all of you,” Snape announced before standing up and
sweeping out of the room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I still think he enchants his robes
to get them to do that,” Minerva muttered. “Back to the matter at
hand, what's got all of you in such a snit?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We're sick of it,” Sinistra
growled. “Don't think for a moment that we're willing to stand for
it even a second longer.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Stand for what?” Minerva asked
with a frown, honestly mystified. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The way you've all got exciting
research projects with Harry Potter and we don't,” Professor
Babbling explained hotly. &quot;We want to be a part of it.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>“Yeah,” Vector agreed. “We
want a chance to show what we can do.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He doesn't even take Runes or Ar-”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“But he does do Quidditch,” Hooch
interrupted,.“Don't think there aren't things I can teach him about
how to handle a broom.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't be vulgar, Rolanda.”
Sinistra giggled. “At least not while he's still a student.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Now who's being vulgar, Aurora?”
Hooch retorted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why don't we get back to the issue
at hand?” Minerva fighting to bring some semblance of order back
into the meeting. &quot;All those interested in taking ownership of
some portion of Mr. Potter's free time, please raise your hand.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna and Hermione literally ran into
their Headmaster when they rounded a corner and collided with the old
man. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Are both you girls alright?”
Dumbledore asked with a grandfatherly smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We are, Headmaster.” Luna replied
after a short inspection. “Or rather, we appear to be.” 
</P>
<P><BR>&quot;Excellent.&quot; He helped
the girls to their feet and turned to leave.</P>
<P><BR>“Professor Dumbledore,”
Hermione called out, shocking herself with how bold she'd become. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“May we use the floo?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” he agreed. “Who
would you like to contact?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Professor Lupin,” Hermione said. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You may use the connection in my
office if you'd like,” he offered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva looked around the room to
assure herself that everyone was satisfied with the deal they'd
worked out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's agreed then?” she asked
sternly. “We will all give Mister Potter extra classes during our
normal office hours using a schedule to be agreed upon at a later
date.”</P>
<P><BR>“Point of order, Minerva.”
Sprout called out. “Will these classes be open to every student
that wishes to take them.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” McGonagall said
quickly. “Well, within reason.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you mean by that?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just that there are certain students
that I would ban from my normal classes if the Headmaster allowed it
and that I have no intention of teaching them in my 'copious amounts'
of free time.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>Harry felt another chill go down his
back, a chill he'd last felt when they'd pulled his name out of the
cup and forced him into the Triwizard Tournament. Something
absolutely horrible had just happened involving him. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I better ask the Professors if I
can have more classes,&quot; Harry said regretfully to himself. He'd
want to be prepared for whatever Voldemort decided to throw at him. A
couple new spells could spell the difference between life and death. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Remus stepped through the fireplace
into the Headmaster's office and regarded the girls with a fond
smile. Thanks to his condition, the werewolf had accepted the fact
that he'd never be able to have children of his own so he regarded
Harry and his friends as the closest he'd ever get to having a
family.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What can I do for you two?” he
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well, it's just that . . . ”
Hermione dithered. “Harry once mentioned something about Snuffles
and I thought that it might be helpful for a project we're doing and
you knew him better then anyone else and I was hoping that . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What it it?” Remus prompted
gently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We wanted to gather information on a
flying motorbike,” Luna supplied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And to examine it if at all
possible,” Hermione added quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You want to know about Sirius's old
bike?” Remus asked in surprise. “I'm not sure what happened to
it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.” Hermione drooped. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think his notes are still back at
Grimmauld Place,” Remus offered. “I could get them for you if
you'd like.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you Remus,” Hermione said
sweetly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Anything for one of Harry's
friends,” Remus replied. “Where do you want me to deliver it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you know where they keep the
Hogwarts Express?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>As promised, Remus delivered Sirius'
notes on construction, zen, and the art of the maintenance of magical
motorbikes along with a large crate containing a number of mysterious
items.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's all this?” Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I found an old Motorcycle that
Sirius used as his model and the tools he used to disassemble it,”
Remus replied, “I'm not sure you want it all though.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why not?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The motorcycle is in pieces and the
tools have to be at least fifteen years old,” Remus explained Not
to mention the fact that Sirius had probably gotten them used,
chances were they were hopelessly out of date by now with the way
Muggles were always changing things. “Wanted to make sure you
didn't want any of it before I threw it out.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No!” Hermione said quickly. “It's
perfect. Thank you Remus.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Happy to help.” The werewolf
grinned. “I'd also be happy to bring you anything else I find like
this if you want.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Please,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione decided to do a quick look
over Sirius' notes while Luna decided to investigate the parts bin.
Two things became quickly apparent as she read over the first couple
pages. The first was that Sirius Black had horrible penmanship. The
second was the the man was a bloody genius when it came to adapting
muggle devices to work on magic. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione!” Luna called out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, Luna?” Hermione
reluctantly dragged herself away from her reading material. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you have any idea what this part
is?” Luna asked with an inquisitive look on her face. 
</P>
<P><BR>“I think that's the frame Luna,”
Hermione replied after a quick glance at the object in the other
girl's hand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmm, just how many frames does a
motorcycle have?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just one,” Hermione said absently.
“Wait, why?”</P>
<P><BR>“Because there are at least six
or seven of these frames in the box, Hermione.” Luna peered down
into the box. “Maybe more under the pile.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh . . . I guess it makes sense that
Sirius would want to look at more then one Motorcycle before making
his own.” Hermione said slowly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you think Harry would like it if
we put them back together?” Luna asked, focusing an intense stare
on the other girl while she waited for the answer. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>Professor Vector favored Harry with a
predatory look as walked into her classroom. If his performance in
the other classes was any indication, he would help her rewrite the
laws of magic and usher in a new age of discovery. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you know why you're here, Mr.
Potter?” she drawled. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, Professor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You are here because of the research
that you've been doing with the other Professors,” she explained. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Oh? What am I going to be doing
with you, Professor?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We are going to see if we can figure
out why and how your new spells work,” Professor Vector purred.
“Wonderful don't you think.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Er . . . why . . . why do we need to
know how they work?” Harry asked hesitantly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why?!” she barked. “Do you think
we should be content to leave things as they are? Do you think that
we shouldn't expend the necessary effort to perfect your new
spells?!”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No?” Harry ventured, not sure he
agreed with the answer but fairly sure he wouldn't like what happened
if he tried to give another. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course not!” she agreed firmly.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course not,” he echoed. Why did
his life have to be so bloody complicated? It was like he was the
universe's spittoon or something. What he needed was a nice quiet
vacation round the world away from all this craziness. 'Better not do
it under my own name though,' he thought to himself. 'No telling how
many crazies I'd run into. Much safer to do it with an alias like Mr.
John Smith, or Mr. Dean Longbottom, or . . .' he had a flash of
inspiration. 'Mr. Something Black.' Sirius would have appreciated the
thought of Harry using his family name to have a bit of fun. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I foresee quite a bit of work ahead
of us,” she added cheerfully, “I hope you don't mind sixteen hour
days.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I do have other classes you know,”
he pointed out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” she agreed. “But this is
your only important class.” The amount of conviction in the woman's
voice was nothing short of terrifying. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna cheered as they got their first
engine to start. It wasn't much but they were fairly sure that they'd
managed to separate enough parts to reassemble one of the
motorcycles. It was fortunate that Sirius has squirreled away a
number of maintenance manuals with his notes. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nice work, Luna.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nice work, Hermione.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The two girls smiled at each other.

</P>
<P>Ron was waiting when Harry finally
managed to escape the Professors and stumble back into the Gryffindor
Common Room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You alright, mate?” Ron asked in
concern. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What day is it?” Harry dodged the
question. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sunday, why?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Cause I've been doing classes all
day,&quot; Harry sighed. Sure he'd asked for a few extra sessions but
he'd never expected them to take it as far as they had. &quot;I'd
almost rather be at the Dursley's . . . nah, but a nap in the
cupboard under the stairs is sounding bloody attractive.&quot; As the
one place in the house guaranteed to be and to have always been
Dursley free, he was actually rather fond of his first bedroom. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bloody hell, mate.” Ron winced.
“Anything I can do to help?”</P>
<P><BR>“Maybe if you'd come along,”
Harry suggested, “it would distract the Professors away from me.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Anything besides that?” Ron asked
mildly. “I mean, ask me to go fight a thousand year basilisk by
your side, no problem. Extra class, well . . . that's something else
isn't it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I saved your life,” Harry
protested. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Only a couple times,&quot; Ron
said reasonably. &quot;Ask for one of my kidneys or something. Or . .
. hey we could go visit the giant spiders in the forest, that'll wash
the tired right out of you!&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Don't think an extra kidney would
help,&quot; Harry said sourly. &quot;Not in the mood for dealing with
spiders bigger than Fluffy either.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well, the offer's on the table if
you think of a way they will help.” Ron scratched his chin. “Least
you've got Hermione's house to hide out in during hols,” Ron said
thoughtfully, “Professors can't get you there.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Where all I'll have to put up
with is Hermione constantly badgering me to study,&quot; Harry said
brightly. “That's pretty much the standard all year anyway, that
won't be so bad.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“As distracted as she'd been, I'll
bet she won't even badger you that much.” Ron grinned. “See, it
aint so bad mate.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How much longer till we get out?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just a few more days,” Ron assured
his friend. Few dozen actually, but he saw no point in being overly
negative. “You think you can last that long?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If I can't, then promise that you
and Hermione will look after Hedwig.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I promise,” Ron agreed solemnly. 
</P>

<P>Minerva was making a few last minute
adjustments to her lesson plans when the door opened to admit the
Head of Hufflepuff House. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Minerva, may I have a moment?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What can I do for you, Pomona?”
Minerva replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was just wondering if we were
pushing Mr. Potter a bit too hard,” the other Professor explained.
“He's starting to look a bit ragged.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes he is,” Minerva sighed. “You
didn't tell him about your concerns did you?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Heavens no,” Pomona laughed.
“Would you mind explaining to me why you're pushing him so hard?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Filius and I talked about it and we
agreed that we're going to push Mr. Potter as hard as we can for the
foreseeable future,” Minerva began. “On the matter of his health,
Poppy has been watching him closer then she usually does and as to
why.” She shook her  head sadly. “Well, he does have several Dark
Wizards out to kill him, doesn't he?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not to mention his horrible luck.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Or the fact that Albus has forbidden
us to give Mister . . . Harry any extra training or special treatment
since, quote; 'it wouldn't be fair to the boy to rob him of his
normal childhood or to the other students to miss out on the extra
instruction.'” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But he is willing to allow Mr.
Potter to aid us in our research,” Sprout said in understanding. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And if Mr. Potter happens to get a
bit of extra training, well that's just a happy accident.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not our purpose at all, neatly
sidestepping the Headmaster's edict against training,” the other
Professor agreed. “Thank you for taking me into your confidence
like this, Minerva.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not at all, Pomona.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry woke up late that morning. Monday
meant that he didn't have any morning 'research sessions' with any of
the Professors and was able to sleep in till a bit after seven.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>A quick check of his schedule confirmed
that he had double Potions after breakfast. He frowned, if someone
had told him at the beginning of the year that he'd see Potions class
as a time to relax then Harry would have laughed in their face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Guess it makes sense,” Harry
muttered to himself as he walked out of the Common Room. “Worst
Snape can do is take points and mark me down when I make a mistake,
the other Professors.” Harry shuddered. “Besides, it's not like
he can assign detentions anymore, not after the other Professors
already divvied up my time among themselves.” Pity he didn't have
Divination or History till Wednesday, he really needed a chance to
catch up on his sleep. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna and Hermione met up after classes
and rushed down to the train shed to continue their latest project. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Course I can do it,” one of the
old machinists agreed after they had explained to him what they
wanted. “Still and all, I think it's a bit of a shame that you
girls have moved away from steam and into internal combustion.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We just need to confirm something,”
Hermione explained. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh yes,” Luna agreed, “it would
be best not to attempt to adapt the spells we found to enchant
internal combustion to steam or Sterling Engines without a couple
tests to make sure that we have a good idea of how they work on
internal combustion.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Safety first,” Hermione added
cheerfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Glad you lasses have that one down,”
the old machinist rumbled in approval. “Give me a few and I'll have
the parts turned out.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thanks,” Hermione said. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” Luna agreed, “we really
appreciate what you're doing for us.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry watched the other students file
out of the Transfiguration Classroom with a forlorn look on his face.
Sometimes he wondered what it was like to be normal, to be free, to
not have to dodge constant murder attempts from dark wizards and
their minions. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for staying behind, Mr.
Potter.” Minerva smiled. “I understand that it can't be easy to
give up so much free time.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Professor.&quot; 'Like I
have a choice.' &quot;What are we doing today?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You are going to go down to the
Quidditch Pitch for a bit of instruction from Madame Hooch,”
Minerva said warmly. “Unless you'd rather not do a bit of flying
that is.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course not, Professor.” Harry
said quickly. “I mean, of course I'd like to do a bit of flying.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“On your way.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Yes, Professor.” Harry was
almost out the door before her voice stopped him. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And don't think I didn't notice that
you transfigured your pillbox into a two headed mouse,” Minerva
said with an amused smile. “When Madame Hooch is finished with you,
I want you to come back here so we can figure out exactly how you did
that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor.” Harry agreed with
considerably less enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Minerva looked at the two headed mouse
in wonder as one head breathed fire on a fly that got too close and
the other head darted forward to eat the fried insect.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione and Luna looked at their new
Motorbike with matching grins. Magic made creating things so much
easier.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay,” Hermione looked down, “why
don't we play with the engine first.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Comfort can wait,&quot; Luna
agreed with sparkling eyes as she set aside the notes on the
silencing and warming charms Sirius had used, &quot;and after that we
can do the destructive testing.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We can figure out why Sirius' notes
say never to combine a couple of the charms,” Hermione corrected,
“if that happens to be explosively destructive then so be it. No
doing anything to hasten that along.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course not, Hermione.” Luna
agreed with a mostly innocent look on her face. “I would never
dream of hastening things along.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione was not convinced by her
friend's apparent sincerity. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry got down to the Quidditch Pitch
and found the flight instructor waiting for him in the broom shed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You look like you have a question,”
she observed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why am I here, Madame Hooch?”
Harry asked. The boy looked at his Professor with bleary eyes, he
hadn't been getting much sleep lately. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“First of all, you may be a good
Quidditch player but don't think that there aren't a few things that
I can still teach you about flying.” <BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course not,” Harry agreed
quickly. “I've read about your time in the league.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Really?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Harry replied. “Most
people.” Including nearly every Quidditch Player at Hogwarts. “Say
that you're the best chaser the Harpies ever had.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hadn't heard that,” she said in
an odd voice. “Back to the point, aside from flying, I'm also a
fairly good broom maker.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;You mean?&quot; Harry perked up
like he'd just taken a pepper up potion.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We're going to craft a broomstick,”
she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wow,” Harry gasped. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm not up to equaling a Firebolt of
course, but it can't hurt to get a better idea of how to craft a
broom.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course not,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We'll start by making you a new
wand.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A wand?” Harry asked in shock. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Uses some of the same principals
and is much easier to do with a limited amount of tools,&quot; she
explained. &quot;I'm afraid we're going to have to wait for a large
enough lathe to arrive to do the broom.&quot; She paused. &quot;This
will also allow you to practice over winter holidays, as the
monitoring charm they use to track underage magic is something I'll
'forget' to cast on it. I think you can handle the responsibility,
but be sure to obey the rules and rule number one is don't get
caught.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I will. How do we make a wand
without the lathes?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Fortunately, I was able to borrow a
couple of small table lathes from my uncle.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your uncle, ma'am?”</P>
<P><BR>“I believe you got your wand from
him,” she replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Olivander is your uncle?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My mother's uncle actually,” Hooch
clarified. “This wand we're going to craft  probably won't be as
good as the one you purchased . . .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But after I make a hundred of them
then they might be half as good?” Harry suggested with a cheeky, if
tired, grin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hopefully not that many,” Hooch
laughed. “Now, the first thing we need to do is . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione remotely started the engine on
their newly constructed test bike and then ducked behind the blast
shield to wait with Luna. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is it supposed to be smoking like
that, Hermione?” Luna asked curiously. “It never did that any of
the other times we started it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't . . .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>BOOOM, the newly constructed bike
engine exploded and flung pieces everywhere. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ehehehehehe.” Luna clapped her
hands. “Let's do it again.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And again and again until we figure
out just why that bug repelling charm makes it explode like that,”
Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How did Sirius solve the problem?”
Luna asked, still flush from excitement. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“His notes say that he just let the
bugs fly into his teeth,” Hermione replied, “I don't think he
cared why it didn't work just that it didn't work.” Hermione
huffed. “Like any typical wizard he just ignored the whole thing.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Us witches are much more sensible,”
Luna cheerfully agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Sensibly, Hermione bit her tongue
before the traitorous thing could say the comment that popped into
her mind. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>

<P>Ron looked up when Harry staggered into
the room. His best friend looked like he'd been put through the
wringer. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Let you off early today, mate?”
Ron asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Madame Hooch is giving me a break,”
Harry replied, “says she wants me to get in a short nap before we
do anything else.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's Hooch got you doing?” Ron
asked curiously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She's going to be teaching me
Quidditch moves later,” Harry replied, “right now we're working
on making wands and brooms.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Quidditch?” Ron asked with a
frown. “She was a bloody good chaser but what's she going to teach
you about seeking?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She's a bloody good seeker too,”
Harry laughed. “Showed me a couple things that I didn't know were
possible to do on a broom.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Makes sense,” Ron agreed slowly.
“Couldn't hurt to learn a few chaser moves either.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Guess not,” Harry agreed. <BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“And since you're making brooms
anyway,” Ron grinned. “Be sure to make an extra one for me 'eh,
mate.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Won't be as good as my Firebolt,”
Harry cautioned. “Not even half as good as my old Nimbus.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But it'll be better then the school
brooms I'd wager,” Ron said quickly. “Tell Hooch that I'd be
happy to play keeper when you guys are practicing.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“I will,” Harry promised. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Get some sleep, mate.” Ron
advised. “You look like you need it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Even with the aid of magic, it took
some time to fabricate a new test bike. Not being the sort to lay
about while others did their work and lacking the skill to help out,
the girls chose to channel their free time into their locomotive
design project. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;What do you think of this,
Hermione?&quot; Luna called out. &quot;I'm fairly sure I've found a
way to give our steam engine a forty percent increase in power.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;It should work, but with that
much power we'd have a hard time making it stay on the rails,&quot;
Hermione complained.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Well, do we really need rails? I
mean, I like trains, but the rails don't really matter to me.” They
were just bits of metal laying on the ground, hardly exciting at all
and dead boring without all the tunnels and bridges. “If we charm
the wheels so they act like they are running on rails when there is
nothing beneath them we could just take to the air and avoid the
whole rail problem.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Hmmm, I wonder how fast we need
to go to leave the Earth.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Seven miles per second for an
unpowered object,” Luna replied cheerfully. “Why do you ask?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've always wanted to visit the
moon,” Hermione admitted.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Um . . .” Luna looked a bit lost. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, Luna?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I can't help but feel that there was
a comment I could have made regarding that statement,” Luna
admitted. “Seeing that my name means 'moon' in Latin.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It'll come to you later,” Hermione
giggled. “Be sure to tell me and we'll pretend you thought of it
now.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It'll make a nice touch when we
write our memoirs,” Luna agreed. “A touch or two of humor will
make the whole thing much more accessible to the average person.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry finished his nap and went
returned to the broom shed where he found Madame Hooch waiting for
him.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Have a good nap, Mr. Potter?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is there something you'd like to
say, Mr. Potter?” years of teaching had made her adept at reading
her student's expressions. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ron was wondering if he could join
us when we practice Quidditch,” Harry said nervously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” she agreed. “You may
bring him with you when we meet tomorrow. If he stays late then we
should have plenty of time to turn out a couple of blanks for him and
he can get started on making his new wand right away.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I . . . er, don't think he was
planning on doing anything that didn't involve flying.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If he doesn't want to show up to one
portion of the lesson then he can skip all of it,” Madame Hooch
said firmly. “He's welcome to come but he is not welcome to cherry
pick the tasks that he wishes to do.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll tell him,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Was there anything else, Mr.
Potter?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well . . .”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would it be possible to make a new
wand out of this, Professor?” Harry held out a long piece of wood. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A piece of your old Nimbus?” Hooch
asked with a raised eyebrow. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't know,” she admitted. “I
don't believe I've ever heard of anyone attempting it before.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.” Harry drooped. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“None of that, Mr. Potter.” She
laughed. “What's the best way to find out if something can be
done?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“To try it. Right, Professor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right,” she agreed. “What were
you planning to use for a core?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wing feather of an overprotective
mothering owl,” Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't recall anyone trying that
either,” she said oddly. “Worth a shot . . . though it might be
best to try it in a more conventional blank to prove the concept.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And to try a more conventional core
in one of my Nimbus blanks,” Harry agreed, “I've spent enough
time around Hermione to learn how important it is to have a control.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The two girls set up their second test
bike and prepared to carry out the experiment.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I've got it,&quot; Luna squealed,
&quot;I've got it, Hermione!&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You've figured out why it keeps
exploding?” Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No,” Luna replied. “I think I
figured out a way to make our locomotive fly.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh?” Hermione pulled out her
notebook. “How, adapting the flight charms used on the motorcycle?”
Hermione frowned. “I'm fairly sure that the locomotive will be a
bit to heavy for them to work reliably.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't think those are powerful
enough either,” Luna said regretfully. “So what if we ignored
them all together.” Luna's smile deepened. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't . . . floating tracks?”
Hermione ventured. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We'll charm a bit the air to
solidify and form into tracks in front of the train,” Luna said
quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;It . . . it might work,&quot;
Hermione muttered, her mind conjuring up pictures of a locomotive
shooting through the clouds.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;We can look into building a model
later,&quot; Luna agreed. &quot;First.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We have to blow up another
motorbike,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Yay!&quot; Luna squealed.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry stumbled into the dorms late that
night and collapsed onto his bed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hooch say anything about me doing
Quidditch with you?” Ron asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Madame Hooch says that if you want
to learn to do Quidditch, then you'll have to come down and make your
own broom.” Harry mumbled. “Sorry mate.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How much time do you have to spend
with her every week?” Ron asked speculatively. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Couple hours,” Harry replied.
“Depends on what the other Professors want to do.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Suppose it couldn't hurt to try it,”
Ron mused, “what do you think Harry?” Ron turned to look at his
friend. “Harry?” only to find that he was fast asleep. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Luna squinted at her
parchment for nearly five minutes before deciding to give up and get
a second pair of eyes on the problem. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>“Do you mind taking a look
at this, Hermione?” she asked. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>“What's the problem,
Luna?” Hermione replied. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>“My figures are off and I
can't see where I'm making the mistake,” Luna replied. “I know my
result can't be true.” 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>“Hmmmmm.” Hermione went
over other girl's parchment three times before she was willing to
admit defeat. “I can't find your mistake either, Luna,” she
sighed. “But you're right, this can't be correct.” 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>“Mug of hot chocolate
before hitting it again?” Luna suggested. “Perhaps a bit of time
away will help us clear our minds?” 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>“Sounds good to me, Luna,”
Hermione agreed.

</P>
<P>McGonagall felt a deep sense of
satisfaction when her prized research subject managed to duplicate
his earlier error to produce several more of the odd creatures. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Very good, Mr. Potter.” Minerva
looked down at the two headed mouse filled cage. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Does that mean I can stop?” Harry
asked hopefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It means that I can replicate your
spell and that you can take these mice down to Hagrid for your next
lesson,” Minerva replied. “Followed by an hour with Madame Hooch
and another with Professor Sinistra.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Harry said in
defeat. Perhaps if he studied every lesson before hand, he could
avoid making anymore mistakes?</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry picked up the cage and trudged
down to the groundskeeper's hut that served as Hagrid's home. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ello, H'arry,” Hagrid said with a
grin, “let's see the little darlings.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Er, here they are, Hagrid.” Harry
handed the cage to the half giant. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wonderful looking things aren't
they?” One of the mice singed the edge of Hagrid's beard when he
got too close. “Now, Perfessor McGonagall tells me that they like
to eat flies. You and I are going to find out what else the lovelies
like to eat, then we're going to see if we can set up a breeding
program fer them.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay, Hagrid.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron considered his options as he ate
his evening meal. On the one hand, real professional training would
be invaluable if he wanted to get into the pros, could even shave a
year or two off his time in the second string. On the other hand,
Hooch expected him to do a lot of bloody useless work carving brooms
before she'd let him do any flying. Ron sighed, he really had no
choice in the matter. The opportunity was just too good to miss. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The boy gathered up his things and
walked down to the Quidditch pitch to meet his friend. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>A grin blossomed on Harry's face when
he saw Ron approach. Truth be told, he was starting to feel a bit
lonely since he begun spending the majority of his time with the
Professors and since Hermione's obsession with mixing technology and
magic had precluded her from attending more then the occasional extra
class with him. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Decided to come along then?” Hooch
asked mildly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bit of extra work is worth it to get
into the pros,” Ron replied seriously. “Let's get the boring part
out of the way first.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Boring part?” she raised an
eyebrow, a gesture both boys would later regard as one of the most
terrifying things they'd ever seen. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The bloody carving,” Ron
explained. “Harry said you wouldn't let me fly without doing that.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” An evil grin bloomed on
the instructor's face, she'd intended to put them through a couple
simple drills, but the little Weasley had inspired her to new levels
of sadism. Little snot thought flying was the fun part? Well, let's
just see how much he enjoyed flying after one of the Harpies 'lost
game' work outs. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Damn it,” Harry cursed. Harry
sometimes wondered why Ron had to be so thick. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Best get the 'boring part' out of
the way first,” Hooch said with a horrific grin. “Don't you think
so, Harry?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Harry sighed. He
really hated his life sometimes. “In fact, I'm suddenly not feeling
well, could I be excused from today's flying?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A quick run around the field is just
the thing to occupy your mind,” she said firmly.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Understood, Professor,” Harry said
glumly. Damn it, why did his friend have to be so bloody thick?!</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione and Luna looked down at the
motorbike with twin looks of accomplishment. It hadn't been easy, but
they'd managed to assemble a complete bike from the jumble of parts
that Remus had delivered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you think Harry will be pleased?”
Luna asked eagerly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm sure he will be,” Hermione
agreed, “I already told you that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I know,” Luna agreed. “It's just
. . . I'm . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's okay, calm down, Luna.”
Hermione put an arm on the younger girl's shoulder. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've never had friends before and
I'm not sure how to act,” Luna confessed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I understand,” Hermione assured
the nervous girl. “I didn't have any friends before I got to
Hogwarts either.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron glanced over as Harry leapt to his
feet and presented something to Professor Hooch. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Which one is that?” Hooch asked as
Harry proudly held up his mostly completed wand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Owl feather core with a Nimbus
body,” Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The Professor watched as Harry gave the
newly constructed wand an experimental wave and for a second, the
world seemed to turn inside out and Hooch would have sworn that she
could see odor of freshly cut wood, taste the sound the wand made as
it cut through the air, and hear the light bouncing off the Weasley
boy's hair. 
</P>
<P><BR>“What in the bloody hell was
that?” Ron asked between dry heaves. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That was a particularly strong
reaction to a wand choosing a wizard,” the flight instructor
choked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is that bad?” Harry asked
nervously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not as such,” Hooch said dryly,
“it does mean that my uncle is going to hound you until he figures
out what happened though.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Another class?” Harry asked
sickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I wouldn't worry about it till you
get out for summer,” she replied The world had finally stopped
spinning and she was beginning to see color again. “He's going to
be spending most of his time collecting raw materials and
constructing wands until early July.” Though he might persuade
himself to make a short side trip after she described what she'd just
seen. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh,” Harry sighed in relief,
dodged that bullet. Well, put it off for a bit anyway. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Now let's see yours,” Hooch said
to Ron, she held out her hand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Er, I'm not quite as far along as
Harry is,&quot; Ron demurred.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Let's see what you've got so far,”
she ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Ron agreed. He handed
her the wand he'd been carving. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Did you do this free hand?” she
asked as she examined the half done wand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Couldn't figure out how to get the
details right with the lathe,” Ron admitted. Well, he told himself,
if it's that bad then maybe she'll just let me skip all this wood
carving stuff and go straight to flying.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why'd you carve this indent into the
handle?” she demanded. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's so I have a place to rest my
thumb,” Ron replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Doesn't feel very comfortable to
me,” she commented. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your thumb is smaller then mine,”
Ron replied patiently, “I'd have done it different if I were
carving it for you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmm.” She pursed her lips and
handed the wand back. “Let's get to flying.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right,” Harry agreed as he reached
for his Firebolt. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“School brooms for both of you,”
she said sharply. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Harry agreed with
considerably less enthusiasm. Why couldn't she be content to prove
her point to Ron and leave him out of it? 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The next two hours were grueling. Harry
would have laughed if he had enough energy, he'd thought Wood was
bad. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Three more passes!” Hooch ordered.
“You have enough energy to smile, you have enough energy to keep
going!” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Harry agreed
weakly. Lesson learned, he was never going to smile again. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Weasley!” Hooch bellowed.“What
in the hell do you think you're doing? Cover that bloody goal post!”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Ron agreed. To
think, he'd once thought that Quidditch was fun. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's enough!” she bellowed after
a few more minutes. “On the ground, both of you!” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How'd we do?” Ron asked hopefully.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Gather your things,” Hooch said,
ignoring Ron's question. “Harry, I want you to take some sand paper
with you to finish up your wand during the holidays. I want you to
get progressively smoother until you get to the ray skin, buff it
after that and rub bees wax into it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Ron, stay behind a bit. I have
something I need to talk to you about.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Ron agreed with a
sigh. He'd thought he had skills until he had a chance to play
against Harry. Even on a school broom and in an unfamiliar position,
Harry was still able to fly rings around him. Wasn't it enough that
Harry was the greatest seeker Gryffindor had seen in god knows how
long, bloody prat had to be a decent chaser too? Bloody unfair. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wait for him outside, Harry,”
Hooch ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I . . . yes, Professor.” Harry
shot his friend a look of sympathy as he walked out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you want, Professor?” Ron
asked in a defeated tone of voice. He steeled himself for what he
knew was coming. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Kid, I've got good and bad news for
you.” Hooch said seriously. “The bad is that you're never going
pro, just don't have the reflexes or the drive.”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“But . . .” Ron felt like his whole
world had collapsed. This was even worse then what he'd expected. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The good is that your carving is top
notch,” she continued. “Not pro level but the potential is there.
If you're willing to devote the time and effort, then some day people
are going to be talking about your brooms in the same breath they use
to talk about Firebolt and Nimbus.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“R . . . really?” Ron looked like a
drowning man that had just caught a life preserver. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I never joke about brooms,” she
said seriously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I, would it be alright to talk with
you about this some more?” Ron asked hopefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“When?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Tonight if possible,” Ron said
quickly. “I . . . I'd like to be able to work on it during
holidays.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hooch pursed her lips. “Potter!”
she called out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor?” Harry stuck his
head back in the woman's office. He caught a glimpse of Ron's smiling
face out of the corner of his eye, maybe Hooch had seen something he
hadn't?</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your friend will be a while, head
back to the castle.” She had a couple weeks to try to drill the
basics into the boy's thick skull, time to see if he had the
followthrough. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Harry agreed
reluctantly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The last Potter was deep in thought as
he made his way back to the castle for a quick shower before his next
'research session.' 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry!” Luna called out. The two
girls ambushed their messy haired friend just before he got to the
main entrance. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” he asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We've got something to show you,”
Luna said breathlessly. “Right, Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” Harry asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a surprise,” Hermione said.
“Right, Luna?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right,” Luna agreed. She was
practically bouncing up and down in excitement. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay, lead the way.” The two girls
each took possession of one of his arms and dragged him down an
unfamiliar path and into the shed that housed the Hogwarts express. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's over here,” Luna said as she
dragged him past one of the massive engines. She flung open the door
to reveal a beat up motorbike sitting in the middle of a large empty
room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry took several stumbling steps
until he was within touching distance of the machine. “Is this?”
Harry stared down at the motorcycle with an unreadable look on his
face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's not the one he made for
himself,” Hermione said softly. She was beginning to get nervous
over Harry's lack of reaction. “It's one of the ones he took apart
so see how they worked.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But it was his, yes?” Harry took a
couple steps forward and ran his hand over the tank, letting his
fingers find every dent and ding.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you,” Harry whispered. “I
used to have dreams about his motorbike you know,” he continued
softly. “I always wanted one of my own, used to fantasize about it
taking me away from the Dursleys forever.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And now you have one,” Luna said
quickly. “Does that make you happy?” She bit her lower lip as she
waited for his reply. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“More then you'll ever know, much
more than I can ever express,” Harry agreed horsely. “Thank you.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You said that, Harry,” Hermione
teased.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So I did,” Harry agreed. His hand
reached out to caress the fuel tank again. “Does it run?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We haven't gotten to that stage
yet,” Hermione demurred. Why in the hell hadn't they thought of
that? 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We wanted to show you right away,”
Luna added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's wonderful,” Harry said
slowly. “Wonderful.” He took one last regretful caress before
turning away. “I have to get to my extra classes.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You can always come back to it
later,” Hermione assured her friend. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>With a last smile for each of the
girls, Harry turned and walked out of the room.. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm glad we were able to do that for
him,” Hermione said with a smile. “Well, back to work.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione,” Luna said suddenly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah, Luna?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If one motorcycle made Harry happy,
how happy do you think he'll be after we assemble all of them?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I . . .” she trailed off when she
noticed the look of hopeful expectation in the blonde's eyes. “Why
don't we find out?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was hoping you'd say that,
Hermione.”

</P>
<P>Harry pulled himself out of bed the
next morning and met Ron and Hermione in the common room. The three
of them stared dully at each other for a few seconds, until Harry
decided to break the silence. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why do you two look so tired this
morning?” Harry asked his friends. After all, he was the only one
being tortured by the Professors. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was up all night doing something
with Luna,” Hermione replied with a yawn. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I spent most of the night working on
my carving after I finished another talk with Hooch,” Ron replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Breakfast?” Hermione suggested.<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Let's go,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Can't wait,” Ron pitched in. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The 'golden trio' walked into the Great
Hall and towards the Gryffindor Tables. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Save me two seats,” Hermione
requested as she broke off from her friends and started walking
towards a blonde mop taking a seat towards the end of the Ravenclaw
tables. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna, Over here,” Hermione called
out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The blonde cheerfully bounced over to
her friend's side. “Yes, Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How can you look so awake?”
Hermione demanded. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I got almost four whole hours of
sleep, Hermione. Why wouldn't I look awake?” Luna asked happily. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's one less then I got,”
Hermione moaned. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I wanted to get all my packing done
before my roommates woke up,” Luna explained. “What is it you
wanted, Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh, uh, would you like to have
breakfast with us today, Luna?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I would be delighted to, thank you,
Hermione.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“After that, the four of us can take
the carriages to the Hogwarts Express together,” Hermione
continued. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm sorry, Hermione. But I was
hoping to get down to help them warm up the engine,” Luna said
regretfully. “But I would love to sit with you on the train if
that's alright with you?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione noticed the way her friend
stiffened up while waiting for the reply. “Of course, Luna. And if
you don't mind, I'd like to go with you to help with the Engine.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll wait for you to finish
packing,” Luna agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I got all that done two days ago,”
Hermione said quickly. “Just let me arrange for my trunk to get
brought down and I'll join you in a minute.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Aren't we going to have breakfast
first?” Luna asked innocently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh . . . right.” Hermione blushed.
“I forgot all about that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The two girls walked over to the
Gryffindor tables and took their places next to Harry on the bench. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Morning, Luna,” Harry greeted the
girl. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good morning, Harry,” Luna replied
with a dazzling smile.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mumph, L'na,” Ron said with a
wave. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good morning, Ronald,” Luna said.
It was so nice to be accepted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for saving us a couple of
seats, Harry,” Hermione said. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Anything for a friend,” Harry
replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hey, Lav. Do you mind doing me a
favor?” Hermione asked her roommate across the table. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” Lavender replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Could you bring Crookshanks and my
trunk down to the common room?” Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure, no problem,” Lavender
agreed. “Anything else?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's all, thank you, Lavender.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Happy to help.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry?” Hermione turned to the boy
on her left with a hopeful look on her face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah, I can get it all on the train
for you.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What are friends for?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If it's not too much trouble, could
you find a compartment at the front of the train?” Luna asked
nervously, surprising herself with how bold she'd gotten. “As far
forward as possible anyway.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure, why?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione and I are going to be in
the Engine compartment when the train pulls up to the station and it 
would be nice to have a short walk,” Luna explained. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ah, okay, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Harry,” Luna said
sweetly.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mister Potter.” McGonagall's voice
caused the students to jump. “Just the person I wanted to see.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was just musing the other day
about how it's a shame that you can't practice magic while you're
away from the castle,” McGonagall began. “Severely limits the
amount of practical assignments I can give you to complete anyway.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Professor,” Harry agreed
neutrally. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Happily, I have a solution.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm going to be permitted to use
magic?” Harry asked hopefully. Granted, he had his newly
constructed wand that Madame Hooch had 'forgotten' to charm, it would
still be nice to be able to do things legally. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm afraid not,” Minerva replied.
“This way, please.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“See you on the train,” Harry said
over his shoulder as he followed his head of house out of the Great
Hall. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>McGonagall led Harry back to her office
and handed him a long rectangular wand shaped box. “Here you are,
Mr. Potter.”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's this, Professor?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a weighted training wand,”
Minerva explained. “Filius tells me that Professional Duelists use
them to practice wand movements.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He opened the box to find a metal
object about the same size and shape of his normal wand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's heavy.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“According to Filius, that the weight
helps one train for a normal duel,” Minerva continued. “The tip
will light up when you make a successful movement, nothing will
happen if you make an unsuccessful movement.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Thanks, Professor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You are very welcome, Mr. Potter.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione and Luna walked in to find the
train shed a hive of activity. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Dinna expect ta see yew garls 'ere
t'day,” one of the firemen said loudly. All activity halted as the
men noticed the two girls. “Woulda tha' tha' yewd be wif yer
mates.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We are,” Luna replied. “Right,
Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right, Luna. And besides, we'll be
with our other friends on the ride down. We're just here to say
goodbye and help you prepare the Express for the run to London.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“An' wer happy ta 'ave it,” the
fireman replied with a grin. “Why don yew start th' inspection?
It'd be a big 'elp.” Granted the Express had already been inspected
and re-inspected, but it wouldn't hurt anything to do it again and it
would keep the two girls from getting underfoot. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right,” Hermione agreed. “Come
on, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The two girls spent the next few
minutes going over every inch of the massive machine, checking and
rechecking every critical part to ensure that there would be no
problems on the run to London. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“All finished then?” The Engineer
asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Neither of us found any critical
problems,” Hermione reported. “But you might want to have a close
look at the steam gauge siphoning pipe.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We couldn't find anything wrong, but
there's something off about it,” Luna added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good job,” he said. He tossed each
of the girls a bundle of clothing. “Change into these coveralls and
stow your good clothes,” he advised. “Gonna get real dirty in a
few minutes.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right,” Hermione agreed. The two
girls retired to the office to change into their new outfits. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione's father sighed in frustration
as he put down the phone. Of all the bloody times for something to
come up. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thomas,” he called out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir?” The driver replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm afraid that we will not be able
to pick up Hermione ourselves,” Philip said with a look of
distaste. “His fists balled up in frustration. “Please tell her
that we have an emergency surgery and that we will see her when she
gets home.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir. Should I take her and her
young gentleman to get something to eat on the way here?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Take her wherever she likes if she
asks. I'd like to have a meal with her, but not if it means she goes
without when she's hungry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir. Should I tell Mrs. Granger
about the change of plans?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll take care of it myself. Thank
you, Thomas, that will be all.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione and Luna watched in
fascination as the crew of the Hogwarts Express went about their task
of running the engine. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nothing exciting from here on,”
the Engineer said loudly. He smiled down at the two soot covered
girls. “Why don't you two clean up a bit and then go see your
friends?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for the ride,” Luna said
sweetly. 
</P>
<P><BR>“It was very educational,”
Hermione added.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come on,” Hermione said as she
dragged the younger girl into the washroom. “Let's get some of this
soot off.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright, Hermione.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Several through cleaning charms and a
bit of soap and water made them presentable enough for polite company
and they stepped out to search for their friend's compartment. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Thomas went over the necessary changes
with the rest of the staff as they prepared to pick up their
employer's daughter from the train station. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No changes for the first half,” he
said in a slow measured tone. “I want the first group to be in
place and keeping an eye out for trouble four hours before the train
comes in.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The snack cart lady was preparing to
make her rounds when she saw the two girls walk past. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Looking for your friends?” She
called out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” Hermione agreed. “Do you
know where they are?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The Conductor put them in the second
compartment of the first car,” the woman said helpfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you very much,” Hermione
said quickly. “Come on, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>It didn't take long for the two girls
to find their friends, but after about fifteen minutes of
socializing, the lack of sleep began to catch up with them. Harry and
Hermione were both sound asleep and leaning on each other for support
and Ron was looking down longingly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you like to lay down on the
bench, Ronald?” Luna asked.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Ron agreed gratefully. “But
where will you go?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I shall sit next to Hermione,”
Luna replied. She walked to the other side of the car, took a seat,
and laid her head on the other girl's shoulder. “Have a pleasant
sleep, Ronald.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Night, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The four of them slept quietly through
the next hundred miles or so until they were discovered by two of
Gryffindors' biggest gossips. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Fetch Colin,” Lavender whispered.
“Or at the very least, fetch his camera.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right,” Parvati agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Lavender stifled a giggle as she
watched her roommate drool on 'the-boy-who-lived' while the blonde
Ravenclaw drooled on her. Oh, they were going to tease Hermione so
much. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Got it,” Parvati whispered.
“Rather, got him.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good work,” Lavender whispered
back. “Colin, do your stuff.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right,” Colin agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>To the dismay of the two gossips, the
flashes woke their sleeping classmates before more then a couple
pictures could be taken. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I suggest we leave,” Lavender said
as she darted out of the compartment. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Quickly,” Parvati giggled. 
</P>
<P><BR>“What was that?” Harry asked
with a yawn. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Couple of gossiping twits,”
Hermione replied with a sniff. “Did you get a good rest, Harry?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “How about
you, Luna?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Marvelous, how was yours, Ronald?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wish it was longer, but I got work
to do, 'eh, Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I really should revise my homework
schedule,” Hermione mused. Hermione glanced at Harry and Luna out
of the corner of her eye. “But I can always do that later,” she
said firmly. “Care for a game to pass the time?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>“I'd love to,” Luna said
happily. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You guys go ahead,” Ron sighed. “I
really do need to take care of this.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Plenty of time for you to join us
later, Mate,” Harry said quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron broke the silence a few minutes
later. “Hey, Hermione, could you hold this and tell me how it
feels?” He asked hopefully. Ron had what appeared to be a twisted
and oddly carved foot long length of broomstick in his hand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure, Ron,” Hermione agreed. She
awkwardly took the stick away from him. “It feels, weird.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're holding it wrong,” Ron said
patiently. 
</P>
<P><BR>“How should I hold it then?”
Hermione asked with a huff. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Follow the twist with your thumb,”
Ron advised. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ah,” Hermione said happily,
“that's much better.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What are you trying to do, Ronald?”
Luna asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Trying to make a custom grip sample
to send to the Harpies,” Ron explained. “Could you try it now,
Luna?”</P>
<P><BR>“Of course, Ronald. I'd be happy
to help,” Luna agreed. She took the grip expertly for a few
seconds. “A bit large for me, but comfortable.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thanks, Luna.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you mean, send it to the
Harpies?” Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Madame Hooch is using her
connections to get it looked at,” Ron explained. “She says that
there's big money in doing aftermarket customizations of factory
brooms and that most of the players like to have their broomsticks
fitted.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Isn't there a lot of competition?”
Hermione asked with a worried frown. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not as much as you'd think,” Ron
said cheerfully. “Most of the companies hate to bother with this
sort of thing.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And where there's a market for
something and a lack of competition, there's money to be made,”
Hermione agreed. “Let me take a look at your business plan later,
okay, Ron?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Business plan?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Dad taught me a little about them,”
Hermione explained. She normally hated to have anything to do with
it, but was willing to dirty her hands to help a friend. “Said it
was something every Granger had to understand.” Even if it cut into
her reading time. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Errr.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“I'll help you write one up
later, okay?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thanks, Hermione.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The Children shucked their robes as the
train pulled into the Station . “Don't forget to charm them to be
lighter before we get off the train,” Hermione advised. She pulled
out her wand and hit her trunk with a couple of spells. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you mind too much doing mine
as well, Hermione?” Luna asked with a faint blush. “I'm not very
proficient with that charm.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, Luna.” Hermione cast a
couple more charms. “I'm always happy to help.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>They stepped off the train and Harry
suddenly found himself enveloped by a pair of Arms.“Harry dear,”
Mrs. Weasley said happily. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hello, Mrs. Weasley.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And Hermione.” Molly released her
captive and grabbed another. “I hear you're planning to stay
together this holiday.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My parents wanted a chance to meet
him,” Hermione explained. “Luna's coming over later too,” she
added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well . . . just be sure that you
don't do anything scandalous,” Molly advised sternly.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Mrs. Weasley.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's not that I don't understand
what it's like to be your age,” Molly continued her lecture. “Just
remember that you've got plenty of time to explore things later, no
need to rush into things.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Mrs. Weasley.” The two red
faced teens agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Leave them alone, Molly,” Arthur
said gently. “Unless you want me to tell the story of the second
floor classroom.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Arthur,” Molly exclaimed. “Not
in front of the children.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sorry that had to happen to you
guys,” Ron whispered to his friends. “But now you know what I
have to live with.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mum says that embarrassing your
children is one of the major benefits of being a parent,” Hermione
sighed. “Guess that's one thing that's the same in both worlds.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Arthur finished his conversation with
his wife and turned back to the two children. “Are you two going to
be alright? It's no trouble to wait with you until your parents get
here.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They should be waiting on the other
side of the barrier, Mr. Weasley,” Hermione said. “I can call
them and wait in the station office if they're not there.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If you're sure,” Arthur said
slowly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It'll be fine, Mr. Weasley,” Harry
assured the man. “Hermione and I both grew up in the muggle world.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well . . . if anything happens or
your parents aren't there, I want the two of you to come back to the
platform and floo me immediately.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We will, Mr. Weasley,” Hermione
agreed quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright.” He sighed. “Just
remember that 'you-know-who' is back and-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We understand, Mr. Weasley,” Harry
said quickly. “We'll be careful.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione and Harry said their goodbyes
to their friends and walked through the barrier to Kings Cross. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thomas,” Hermione squealed. She
ran up to an imposing man with close cropped grey hair and threw her
arms around him. “Did you miss me?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We all did, Ms. Hermione.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry, this is my mother's driver,
Thomas.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pleased to meet you, sir,” Harry
said politely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thomas, this is my friend, Harry
Potter.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The pleasure is all mine, Mr.
Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where are mum and dad?” Hermione
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your parents had to do an emergency
surgery,” the grey haired driver explained. “They'll meet you at
Matchingham Hall.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just leave your trunk here, Harry,”
Hermione said to her friend. “The other car will take care of it.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Other car?” Harry asked dumbly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“One for people, the other for the
trunks,” Hermione agreed. Actually, there were two other cars one
for chase and the other to lead but security was never something that
Hermione ever concerned herself with or even noticed the majority of
the time. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione grabbed Harry by the wrist and
dragged him out of the station. “Where's the car, Thomas?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's the S-Class, Ms. Hermione,”
the burly driver replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Daddy bought another one?”
Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Ms. Hermione.” The driver
opened the back door for his charges and helped them into the back
seat of the roomy sedan. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione,” Harry whispered as the
car pulled away from the curb. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>She shot him an odd look. “What is
it?” Hermione whispered back. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is he a wizard,” Harry whispered.
He fingered his wand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't think so,” Hermione
replied, “why?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Cause he's got something hidden
up his sleeve,&quot; Harry replied. Hermione was surprised to see her
best friend's wand appear in his hand as he focused on a point at the
base of the driver's neck.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thomas,” Hermione called out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Ms. Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;What do you have hidden up your
sleeve?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;You noticed that?&quot; he asked
with a grin. He stopped the car and pulled up his sleeve to reveal a
wicked looking double edged dagger. &quot;Like to keep it on hand to
open letters and such.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>“Thank you, Thomas.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not at all, Ms. Hermione.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Satisfied?” Hermione whispered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Harry agreed sheepishly. “I
just noticed that he had something that looked like a wand and I
started thinking about Polyjuice and . . . well . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I understand.” She patted him on
the leg. “It must be terrible for you, what with 'you-know-who'
back.”

</P>
<P>As they rolled up the driveway to
Hermione's house, Harry got his first glimpse of the massive manor
house that was to be his home for the winter holiday. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000cc"><B><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Description

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's where you live?” Harry
murmured in shock. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“On weekends and holidays,”
Hermione agreed. “Why, is there something wrong with it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's huge,” Harry replied. “You
never said your house was so big.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It isn't,” Hermione corrected him.
“My house is in London and it isn't nearly so large.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then what do you call that thing?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I told you,” Hermione said in
exasperation. “It's the weekend house.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh,” Harry said faintly. 
</P>
<P><BR>“I really don't see what the big
deal is anyway,” Hermione continued. “It isn't even half the size
of Hogwarts.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bit more than a third,” Harry
agreed mumbled back. He didn't think it would be productive to point
out the fact that Hogwarts was built to house an entire staff and
student body, while her 'weekend house' kept only one family. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione was able to contain herself
until they came to a stop at the front entrance. “Thomas, did they
transfer my library?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, Ms. Hermione,” the
burly driver agreed. “You don't think we'd be cruel enough to keep
your books from you?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sorry, Thomas,” Hermione said
contritely. She captured Harry's wrist in an unbreakable grip. “Come
on, I wanna show you my books.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The large driver smiled as the girl he
thought of as a daughter dragged her victim into the house. It was
good to have her back, if only for a couple weeks. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna waited patiently until they got
home before she asked her father where their search for elusive
creatures would take them that year. The answer shocked her to the
very core. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The back garden of course,” her
father replied proudly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why not some mysterious land?”
Luna asked with a frown. <BR><BR>“Because that's where we'd expect
them to be.” Her father gave a knowing wink. “They're eleven
steps ahead of us, so . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We've got to be on a twelve step
program,” Luna cheered. “You're brilliant, father.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I have my moments,” he said
modestly. “This will also let you spend more time with your
friends,” he added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh?” Luna cocked her head. “How
so?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We can't spend all our time
searching,” he said with another knowing wink. “We've got to set
some aside to lull them into a false sense of security.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Luna agreed. “It
makes so much sense.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“That it does.” He winked
again. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But first, there's something we need
to do,” Luna said firmly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's that?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We need to get you to a healer,”
Luna replied seriously. “There's something wrong with your eye.”
She gave him a look full of reproach. “You haven't been taking care
of yourself without me around to watch you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione dragged Harry into a large
room filled with books and showed him a large comfy looking chair
before disappearing into the stacks. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>She returned a few moments later with a
lithe woman in a modest dress. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry, this is Ms. Jane, the
librarian,” Hermione said respectfully. “She was my governess
before I went to Hogwarts.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A pleasure to meet you,” the woman
said kindly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The pleasure is all mine,” Harry
replied gallantly. Something about the woman put him on guard, he
wasn't sure why but it was a feeling he'd gotten from all the
servants in the Granger household. “Any friend of Hermione's is a
friend of mine.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ms. Jane, this is Harry Potter.”
Hermione beamed up at the woman. “He's the one I told you about.”</P>
<P><BR>“Yes,” the woman said
thoughtfully. “I believe there were references to him in a couple
of the new books.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Which ones?” Hermione asked
excitedly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They're on my desk,” the librarian
said with a fond smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll be right back,” Hermione
announced before darting off. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Ms. Jane?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione is very special to me.”
The woman looked down at him. “If you let anything happen to her,
I'll kill you,” the woman announced calmly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry couldn't help himself, he burst
into laughter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You think I'm joking?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No.” Harry wiped the tears off his
face. “I think the two of us are going to get along very well.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>A look of confusion appeared on the
woman's face. “I . . .” Her mouth snapped shut when she heard the
sound of returning footsteps. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You didn't tell me there were so
many,” Hermione said as she walked up. She frowned when she noticed
the looks on their faces. “Did something happen?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We were just surprised to find out
how much we had in common,” Harry explained to his friend. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's so rare to find someone who can
understand you so well,” Ms. Jane agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I knew you two would get along,”
Hermione said in relief. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Was there anything else you needed?”
the librarian asked Hermione with her newly returned smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No thank you,” Hermione said
politely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then I shall leave you to your
reading.” She gave Harry an appraising nod. “Mr. Potter.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ms. Jane.” Harry's eyes tracked
the woman until she was out of sight. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I found a defense book in the new
stack that I thought you might enjoy,” Hermione enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you.” He took the book from
his friend. “Is there another chair in here?”</P>
<P><BR>“We can both fit on this one,”
Hermione replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil Granger was waiting outside the
operating theater when his wife stepped out. He could tell by the
look on her face that it was going to be one of those 'fun'
conversations. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Problem?” He asked gently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why don't we wait until we get into
the car before we discuss it,” she suggested. “For that matter,
why don't we get to the car right now? I can change into real clothes
after we get home.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If you like,” he agreed. He nodded
to someone further down the hall. “James should have the car
waiting for us outside.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you,” she sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He waited until they were safely in the
car before he breached the subject again. “So what's got you so
tense?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bloody fool,” she growled. “I've
told him for years that he needed to do some major work, but no, he
was too busy. And then now, on the day I was suppose to meet our
daughter at the station, the idiot breaks something and absolutely
has to get it fixed right away.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Should have made him wait,” Phil
murmured. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I would have if I'd known what it
looked like before hand,” she sighed. “Bloody fool made it sound
like he was dying.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then he'll have no complaints when
he sees how large the bill is.” Both official and unofficial.
&quot;Emergencies are expensive and dentists with the proper
clearances are hard to come by.&quot; Doubly so if they had to be
'socially acceptable' too.   
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne moved across the seat to snuggle
up with her husband. “Philistine.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He raised the privacy screen. “High
bred fop.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry and Hermione were deeply
engrossed in their books when the sound of someone clearing their
throat caught their attention. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your parents have called and they
are on their way,” a man in a distinguished looking suit announced.
“You may wish to take the opportunity to freshen up before dinner.”
</P>
<P><BR>“Right,” Hermione agreed. “Come
on, Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Perhaps Mr. Potter would like to
freshen up in his own quarters,” the butler suggested delicately. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thanks,” Harry said gratefully.
“Where are they?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll have someone show you to your
room,”  the butler offered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I can show him,” Hermione
volunteered. “This way, Harry.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna cautiously stalked her prey.
Slowly, carefully, she moved closer and closer until she was close
enough to make her final lunge. With a cry of triumph, she leapt to
her feet and held her prize aloft. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Look what I found, father,” Luna
called out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The man hurried over. “What is it?”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It appears to be a frog,” Luna
replied with a smug smile. “I must admit that it had me fooled at
first.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But not now,” he agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nope, not since I had a flash of
brilliant inspiration.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, it all makes so much
sense now. If they're willing to trick us by hiding near our home . .
.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It stands to reason that they'll try
to trick us by pretending to be ordinary creatures,” Luna finished.
She glared down at the frog. “And to think, you almost got away
with it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Croak,” the confused frog replied.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna grinned. “Hah, you aren't gonna
fool me now that I know the truth.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>A bead of sweat worked its way down the
'frog's' brow. “Croak?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione allowed Harry five minutes of
peace before she started pounding on his door and demanding that he
open it. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hurry up, Harry,” she called 
through the door. “My parents will be here any minute now and I
want you to meet them.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just a second,” Harry called back.
He pulled his pants on and opened the door. “Well?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione gave him a critical once over,
noting every little thing he'd gotten wrong. “Where's your tie?”
She demanded. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I need a tie?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I want you to make a good
impression,” Hermione said firmly. “So you need a tie.” She
brushed past him and began rummaging through his trunk. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Go right ahead,” Harry muttered.
“No, I don't mind. Feel free to look through my trunk, what's mine
is yours.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione showed no sign that she'd
heard a word he said. After a few seconds of rummaging, she pulled a
scarlet tie out of the trunk with a look of triumph on her face. “Did
you say something, Harry?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nothing you'd like to hear,” Harry
replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay.” Hermione looked around for
a moment. “Sit on the bed,” she ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He complied, knowing that it was best
just to ride it out until she'd run out of steam and her mood
changed. “Fine,” Harry sighed. Sometimes, it wasn't easy being
Harry Potter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a good thing that Ron's such a
slob or I'd never have gotten enough practice to do this,” Hermione
said conversationally as she tied Harry's tie. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm perfectly capable of tying my
own tie,” Harry grumbled. “I do it at school every day.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes but you seem to favor a Shelby
knot while Daddy always seems to wear his tied in a Windsor,”
Hermione replied. “Personally, I think the Shelby looks better, but
we want to make a good impression on daddy so we're going with the
Windsor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Finished?” Harry asked with a much
put upon sigh. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Let me see your teeth,” Hermione
ordered. She inspected them for several seconds before giving her
grudging approval. “Alright, let's go.” She froze and stared out
the window at something in the distance. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I could have had a nice relaxing
holiday at Hogwarts,” Harry grumbled to himself. “Or I could have
worked as a slave for the Dursleys, but noooo. I had to spend the
winter with my friend. Who knew she got worse when she was at home?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Did you say something, Harry?”
Hermione asked absently.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nothing important. Why?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Because my parents are here,”
Hermione squeaked. “Hurry.” She seized his wrist and darted out
of the room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>She finally came to a quivering halt in
front of the main entrance. She didn't have long to wait before her
parents came in. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mum,” Hermione squealed. “Daddy.”
She threw herself into their arms. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I missed you too, Pumpkin,” Phil
murmured. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“James.” Hermione disengaged
herself from her parents and hugged her father's burly driver. “I
missed you too.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Glad to know that someone does,”
the large man said with a pleased grin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione stepped back and placed
herself at Harry's side. “Mum, daddy, James, this is Harry Potter.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pleasure to finally meet the boy
that fills so much of our daughter's letters home,” Anne said
cheerfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Glad you decided to join us for the
winter holidays,” Phil added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for inviting me,” Harry
said politely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione seized him by the wrist again.
“Come on, Harry. You can sit next to me.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Her parents shared a grin as they
watched their daughter drag the boy out of the room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you remember her being that high
strung?” Anne asked blandly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“There's certainly nothing like that
on my side of the family,” he replied. “I'd hoped that having
good stock on her sire's side would counter the inbreeding on the
dam's.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hold that thought till we have a
chance to be alone,” Anne said in a husky voice. “Oh, and don't
think I've forgotten your crazy uncle Charlie.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Great Uncle, and by marriage.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Later, darling.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Right,” he agreed. Arm in arm
they strolled after their daughter.

</P>
<P>Anne and Phil shared a smile when they
entered the dining room and found the two children sitting side by
side. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's considered customary to sit
across from each other, darling,” Phil said with a smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I always sit next to Harry like
this,” Hermione said with a slightly raised chin. It also put her
in the perfect position to whisper advice to her friend and to make
sure he used the proper fork. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Delightful idea,” Anne cheered,
managing to conceal most of the amusement she felt at the situation.
“We shall of course sit across from you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“An informal atmosphere is best when
trying to get to know someone,” Phil agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The food began arriving shortly after
everyone took their seats. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So tell me about this sport of
yours, Harry,” Phil began the small talk. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's played on brooms, sir.” Harry
began. “You got to fly around and dodge bludgers . . . er, balls,
while trying to toss a different kind of ball through a hoop. I'm a
seeker so my job is to try to catch a third kind of ball.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hard to find this third ball?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's about the size of one of your
golf balls, daddy,” Hermione interjected. “Harry has one of the
best records as a seeker in school history,” she boasted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How difficult is it to ride a
broom?” Phil persisted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Er . . .” Harry glanced at
Hermione, not wanting to say anything that could remind his friend of
one of the few subjects where she was not in the top of the class. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's very difficult,” Hermione
said quickly. “Harry is the best at that in school.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmmm.” A smile appeared on Phil's
face. “Ever ridden a horse, Harry?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, sir, but I've ridden a
hippogryph and a Thestral.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione's parents glanced at their
daughter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They're kinds of flying horses,”
Hermione explained. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil gave Harry a speculative look. “I
wonder if . . .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not at the table,” Anne chastised.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione frowned. “No what at the
table, Mum?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your father has become obsessed with
polo lately,” she sighed. “I thought he'd gotten over it after
you were born.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was focused on other things.” He
smiled at Hermione. “Like my lovely new daughter. With you away at
school most of the year, I need to do something with my time.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your father is getting old and the
doctor says he needs to exercise,” her mother translated. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And I can only play so much golf
before it gets boring,” Phil agreed.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne grinned mischievously and leaned
across the table to whisper to her daughter. “Personally, I think
your father is trying to recapture the faded glory of his youth. Next
thing you know, he's going to go out shopping for a young trophy
wife.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No danger of that,” he quipped.
“I've already got one.” He reached under the table and did
something that caused Anne to give a surprised squeak. The two adults
smiled at each other. “Back to the lovely conversation I was having
before I was so rudely interrupted by my trophy wife.” He turned
back to Harry. “What is your favorite subject? I was always partial
to studying the Tap myself,” he added with a grin, thinking of the
long hours he'd spent drinking in Eton's pub. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Defense is my favorite,” Harry
replied. “Even if the teachers aren't always the best.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry's the top student in our
year,” Hermione said proudly. “He's so good at it that students
in the upper years come to him for help.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Better then you, Pumpkin?” Phil
asked with a look of profound innocence on his face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“In the practical portions,”
Hermione allowed. “I have the edge on theory.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil raised a speculative eyebrow after
hearing his daughter not just admit, but proudly state that someone
else was better then her at something academic. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And on everything else in the other
classes,” Harry added. “She's the top student in our year.” He
smirked when he noticed his friend blush a deep red, two could play
at this game. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The four of them continued their chat
through the meal and beyond until Anne gave a deep yawn. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Never was much of a night person,”
she said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So we may as well cut things off
there,” Phil added. “It was lovely chatting with you, Harry.”
He pretended not to notice when Hermione leaned over to whisper
something into the boy's ear. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It was good talking with you too,
sir,” Harry said politely. “I look forward to continuing our
conversation tomorrow.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry barely managed to suppress his
reflexes when the butler suddenly appeared by his elbow. “Would sir
like to have a guide back to his rooms?” He asked formally. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uh?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll take him,” Hermione chirped. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Really, Ms. Hermione, it's rather
far from your suite.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I moved him to the free one in my
hallway,” Hermione explained. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You did?” The butler said sickly.
This new development would make the job of keeping the two teens
apart a hundred times more difficult. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione giggled. “I can't believe
you were going to put Harry on the other side of the house when the
room adjoining mine is still free, you're usually much more efficient
then that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes . . . well, we thought you might
like to save that for your other friend,” the butler offered. “The
girl.” Since the staff viewed Hermione's other, yet to arrive guest
with much less trepidation. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna can stay with me when she comes
here,” Hermione said with an unconcerned wave. “I'm used to
having roommates, more used to it than I am having the room to myself
because of Hogwarts.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“As you say, Ms. Hermione,” the
butler agreed sourly. He looked down at the boy and waited a few
moments until the girl he thought of as the daughter he never had
turned her attention away for a moment. “I shall have one of the
staff waiting in the hall in case you need anything,” he said
calmly. “Just open the door and they'll see you.” Thank all that
was holy for the fact that the two suites weren't connected, he
thought to himself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Um . . . okay,” Harry agreed. “But
I don't want to be a bother.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“It's no bother,” the butler
said firmly, searching the boy's face for any sign of disappointment.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thanks, then.” Harry was sure that
he was missing something. “I appreciate all the trouble you're
going to for me.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil grinned as he watched the butler's
defense of his daughter's virtue before the oblivious girl dragged
her equally oblivious potential suitor off to their wing of the
house. It was so wonderful to see things from the outside for once.
He snapped himself back to reality when his wife mumbled something. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm sorry, dear,” Phil said
softly. “But I didn't quite catch that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm going to bed now that I no
longer have to play hostess,” she repeated.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll join you shortly then,” he
replied. “I need to speak to Thomas for a moment first.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hurry,” she said in a husky voice.
“I've got something I'd like to discuss with you before I drift
off.”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll be there as soon as I can,”
he promised. Phil spent a few moments admiring the sight of his wife
leaving the room before returning to the task at hand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He found her driver waiting outside the
dining room with a massive sandwich in his hands. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for waiting, Thomas,”
Phil said politely. “Now, if you would be good enough to give me
your first impressions of our guest?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Seems like a good kid,” the driver
said after a moment of thought. “Seems a bit put out by the way Ms.
Hermione likes to hover over him.” He paused for a moment. “Also
seems to be a bit shocked by how large the house is.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see, anything else you'd like to
add?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mr. Harry noticed my baby
Fairbairn,” the driver reported. “Seemed to relax when he noticed
it was a knife. Was all set to do violence before that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Probably thought it was a wand,&quot;
Hermione's father said thoughtfully, &quot;did he notice your
pistol?&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, sir. I don't believe he did.”
The driver scratched his chin for a moment. “Well, might have
noticed that I had something hidden but I don't believe he realized
what it was.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Thomas, that will be
all.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna adjusted the light so that it bore
down on her unfortunate prisoner. With a look of barely repressed
fury on her face, she stalked closer and leaned across the table to
let her target experience the full weight of her glare. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Confess!” she said sharply. “We
know everything you know and it'll only go harder on you if you don't
talk.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna, calm down. Can't you see
you're scaring our guest,” her father chided as he put a glass of
water on the table. “Have something to drink,” he addressed the
prisoner. “I'm sorry about my daughter's behavior, but she's crazy.
You really should talk,” he confided. “I don't know what she's
liable to do if she gets all worked up.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's it,” Luna shouted. “I've
had it.” She picked up a chair and made to brain their prisoner
with it. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You mustn't,” her father said in
alarm. He rushed across the room and attempted to wrestle the chair
away from his daughter. “I don't know how long I can hold her off,”
he said desperately. “Say something, anything, so I can calm her
down.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Croak,” the frog offered
nervously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione skipped happily down to
breakfast the next morning and took her seat at the table across from
her parents who'd apparently decided to continue sitting side by
side.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where's Harry?” Anne asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I thought it best to let him sleep
in.” Hermione shot a grateful look to the maid as her breakfast was
put on the table. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How come he gets to sleep in?”
Philip grumbled to his wife. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He's on vacation and not married to
me,” Anne replied cheerfully. “Aside from that, one made you get
up.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What was it you did this morning
then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I just provided a bit of
encouragement,” Anne said innocent. She turned to her daughter. “Do
you have any plans for today, darling?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione's eyes widened as a thought
occurred to her. “Just one, mum.” She turned to her father, doing
her best to look both cute and innocent. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes?” He prompted wearily. Years
of parenthood making him all but immune to the girl's attempts to
manipulate him in that fashion. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Daddy,” Hermione began. She
twirled her hair around her fingers and batted her eyes cutely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, darling?” He said in a
tone that conveyed his real meaning. 'What do you want?'</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is it alright if I store Harry's
motorbikes with your cars?” she asked sweetly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course it is, darling.” He
grinned, he hadn't known the boy was a petrolhead. He'd have to
remember to have a look to see if the boy had anything interesting.
Likely not, but who knew, he might have an old Commando or one of the
other classic British bikes. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“May I also use your shop to perform
maintenance on them?” Hermione asked sweetly. “And to assemble
the ones we haven't got to yet?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course you may, darling.” He
was really going to have to have a word with her daughter's friend,
hopefully the boy would be willing to share his secret. The man
regarded his wife out of the corner of his eye. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Was that all, darling?” Anne asked
with a smirk to inform her husband that she'd caught his stray
thought. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'd also like to spend some time
with you, mum,” Hermione added with a blush. “There are some
things I'd like to ask you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, darling,” Anne agreed.
“I wasn't planning on going out today so anytime that's convenient
for you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, mum.” She turned back
to her father. “What's your first impression of Harry, Daddy?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Seems like a well brought up young
man,” he said smoothly.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you think he'd like to learn
polo?” she asked shyly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll be sure to ask him later,”
her father promised. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, daddy.” She smiled,
pleased that her father seemed to approve of her best friend. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna sighed as she flopped into her
favorite chair, the green one with the automatic foot massager. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sixteen hours,” she mumbled.
“Sixteen hours and he refuses to crack.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We'll have everything when he does,”
her father said confidently. “The lower levels don't get the kind
of training needed to withstand an interrogation like that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What if . . .” Luna trailed off. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What if it really is just a frog?”
Luna said unsurely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then god help us, god help us all.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil was the only person still at the
table when Harry made his way down stairs that morning, his wife and
daughter having long since deserted him in favor of things he was
better off knowing nothing about. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry, a word.” Phil motioned for
Harry to join him. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, sir?” Harry asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;How did you get my daughter to
assemble and maintain your motorbike collection?&quot; Philip asked
intently, hoping that he could he use the same method to convince his
wife to do the same? His daughter had never shown the slightest
interest in mechanical things before, which offered a shred of hope. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Hermione and Luna thought that I
might wish to have them,&quot; Harry explained. &quot;They belonged
to my godfather,&quot; Harry added, &quot;though with the way they
play with them it's more along the lines of keeping their toys
cleaned and polished for when they want to try out a new
enchantment.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No problem, sir.” Harry looked
around. “Is Hermione up yet?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Up and eaten. She's with her mother
right now, they're having a mysterious conversation about feminine
mysteries.” He waved to the staff to prepare the boy's breakfast.
“You may not see her for a few hours.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay,” Harry agreed. A sudden
thought occurred to him. “Um, sir?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, Harry?” Phil replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was just wondering . . .” Harry
trailed off. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes?” he prompted. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Why did you forbid Hermione to
use magic to fix her teeth?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She told you that?” he sighed.
This again?</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We didn't forbid her, we told her
that we wanted to research magical healing before we made a decision.
You may not have noticed, but my daughter tends to put a lot of faith
in books. My wife and I would rather get a look at the effects of
magical healing before we commit to anything. Make sense?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Perfect sense, sir,” Harry agreed.
He made a mental note to check up on the man's worries. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Now that I've answered your
question, do you mind if I ask one of my own?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What would you like to know, sir?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Tell me, Harry, what do you know
about polo?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's got something to do with
horses,” Harry said hesitantly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And that's all,” Harry confessed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How would you like to learn?” Phil
asked eagerly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Harry agreed. It would give
him an excuse to get away from Hermione when she was in full study
mode after all. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Excellent,” Phil cheered. “Now,
the first thing you need to know is . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil spent an enjoyable morning
teaching the attentive boy almost everything he'd need to know to get
started on the polo field later, well, he did until his daughter
arrived to claim his new polo partner. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come on, Harry,” Hermione said,
bursting with enthusiasm. “We've still got a bunch more books to
read.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne strolled into her husband's office
with a devilish grin on her face. “You'll never guess what I just
found out.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The joys of being a productive
member of society?” He asked snidely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hold that thought,” she said
quickly. “We can get to the fun stuff later.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That good huh?” Phil rubbed his
hands together in anticipation. “What is it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The staff has decided that they need
to protect Hermione's virtue from Harry's despicable intentions,”
she giggled. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How do they know that Harry had
despicable intentions?” Phil asked with an amused grin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He's a teenaged boy,” she replied.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Point,” he agreed. “On the other
hand, I'm not sure that Hermione has realized that.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She is a bit focused on her
studies.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And then there's the fact that
they've been friends since their first year,” Phil pointed out.
“She probably still sees him as a scruffy-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Let's stop there,” Anne suggested.
“Wouldn't want to get into the habit of calling him that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil grinned widely. “Not after the
way Hermione reacted to my last off handed comment,” he agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just the sort of thing I'd have
expected to hear from a capitalist pig who made his living off the
sweat of the masses,” she sneered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll have a word with the staff
later,” he promised. The expression on his face turned sinister.
“Hah. As if a blue blood like you knows anything about the working
class.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The patriarch of the tiny Lovegood clan
walked into the interrogation room and flopped down on the chair.
With a sigh, the man favored the prisoner with a look that mixed
sympathy and resigned exasperation just as page seventy five of the
manual they'd dug up from the deepest part of the Lovegood library
had advised. It was quite fortunate that they'd had an ancestor that
had been employed, for a time, with the Keystone police department
and even more fortunate that he had written a manual containing
everything he had learned during his years on the force. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She's a good girl,” he said
softly. “Just a bit high strung.” The man reached into his pocket
and pulled out a large plump cricket. “I don't think she'd do
anything to hurt you . . . well, not unless she got disgruntled
anyway.” He absently popped the cricket into his mouth and began
chewing. “Then she's liable to anything.” He pulled another
cricket out of his pocket. “The thing is . . . oh, how rude of me.
Would you like one?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Croak.” The frog's entire
attention was on the struggling insect in the disturbed man's hand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Here you go then.” He held out the
cricket, allowing the frog to gobble it down. “As I was saying . .
.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Father!” Luna's voice carried into
the room. “Where's my dinner?! You know how I get when I haven't
had my dinner! Disgruntled is how I get!” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh dear,” he said in alarm. “She's
getting disgruntled, I only hope that I haven't left things too long.
But if I have and she doesn't calm down soon.” He shuddered in
fear. “Please, just tell me something, anything I can use to
distract her.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Croak.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione dragged her best friend into
the library and loaded his arms with what she considered a minimum
amount of books to have at hand for a bit of light reading. The table
beside her favorite chair didn't so much as creak under the combined
weight of the tomes having been specially constructed for the purpose
after its predecessor had begun to show signs of wear. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That should last us for a couple
hours anyway,” Hermione said in a tone of deep satisfaction. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The librarian smiled as her young
charge plopped into her favorite chair. “I took the liberty of
getting another chair for young Mr. Potter,” Ms. Jane said loudly.
“So you won't be forced to use the same one like you did
yesterday.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We don't mind,” Hermione said
obliviously. “But thank you for the thought.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry gave a helpless shrug in reply to
the disapproving look on the woman's face. Hermione scooted to one
side of the chair to make room and settled her legs on his lap after
he sat down. It didn't take long before Harry had immersed himself in
a rather fascinating book on the defensive use of common house hold
charms. He was ashamed to admit that he'd never considered how lethal
a charm to boil water could be if properly targeted. Voldemort and
his merry band of catamites and killers were going to be in for a
surprise the next time he had the misfortune of running into them. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sorry to disturb the two of you,”
Phil said, causing the two teens to jump at the sudden interruption.
“But I was wondering if I couldn't have a bit of time with my
daughter.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, Daddy?” Hermione
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've got a surprise for you,” Phil
said mysteriously. “Harry?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was planning on going to the
stables after lunch and I was wondering if you'd like to accompany
me?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'd be delighted to, sir,” Harry
agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Excellent.” He smiled. “And
please, call me Phil.” He placed a fatherly arm around his
daughter's shoulders and gently led her out of the room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione was able to contain her
curiosity for nearly three minutes as her father led her towards the
garage. “What's the surprise, daddy?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You'll find out when we get to the
garage, darling,” he replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is it magical?” Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Some would say that, but it's not
your sort of magic,” he replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione chewed her lip. “Is it
bigger then a bread box?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It is,” He agreed. “Smaller than
a shipping container and it comes in several colors.” Phil led his
daughter into the garage and came to a stop in front of a large
crate. “Here it is.” He lifted the lid to allow Hermione a look
at the contents. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's this?” Hermione asked,
fascinated by the mechanical mystery she'd been presented with. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a kit car, darling,” her
father replied. “We found several of these unfinished kits in one
of the new properties.” He decided not to mention the fact that
their existence was the primary reason he'd closed the deal. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's this one?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a sports car,” he replied, “a
Lotus 7 to be precise. I thought you might like to put it together.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm not sure I can without Luna,”
Hermione admitted. 
</P>
<P><BR>“She is still coming here isn't
she?” he said with a smile. “I thought you girls might like
something to do while you're here and I thought you might wish to
receive your first automobile. I did when I was about your age and
thought it might be nice to continue the tradition.” His smile
deepened. “If you find that you enjoy it then it would be my
pleasure to find a shared hobby.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You like assembling cars?”
Hermione asked in shock. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I prefer collecting them,&quot;
he admitted, &quot;but to spend time with my daughter I'm quite
willing to get my hands dirty.&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione rummaged around the container
for a few minutes until she found what she was looking for. Holding
up the manual with a look of triumph. She began thumbing through it,
detached from the world. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER id="ch7">Chapter 7</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna slowly walked into the room and
made a deliberate show of locking the door behind her. Page sixty
seven of the manual had contained several ideas on how to put the
prisoner in the proper state of mind for what was on page forty six.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Father is such a sweet man,” Luna
purred. “So innocent, but not the two of us.” She shot the frog a
jaded look. “We know how the world works and that's why you're
going to tell me everything I want to know.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Croak.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm tired of playing around,” Luna
growled. Her left hand focused the light on the frog. “Either you
tell me what I want to know or I'll bury you. You got me?!” Luna
screamed. “I'll bury you!” She pulled a phonebook out of her
pocket and let it drop onto the table in front of her prisoner. “I
think you know what I need that for,” she said menacingly. She
hoped he did anyway as she wasn't too sure of what use it was
supposed to have in an interrogation, maybe she was supposed to read
it to him or something? Pity her ancestor hadn't been more detailed
with some of the more confusing bits. “Where should we start?”
She giggled shrilly. “Or should I just-” Her rant cut off when
someone knocked on the door which was odd as her father was supposed
to wait for his cue before barging in to save the prisoner. She
carefully unlocked the door and peered out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We're gonna have to cut him loose,”
her father said unhappily. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why?” Luna asked with a pout. “The
Sedition Act lets us hold him for up to two weeks without being
charged.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“His lawyer's here with a writ
ordering us to release him,” her father explained. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna opened the door wider, revealing
another confused frog, this one in a tiny business suit. “How do
you know he's a lawyer?” She asked curiously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He's wearing a business suit,” her
father explained. It had taken hours to get it to fit right on the
tiny amphibian. “I realized after I got the suit onto him.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Isn't there anything we can do?”
Luna pled. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not unless you managed to get him to
talk,” her father sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Woof,” their prisoner barked, the
'frog's' fragile sanity shattered by the latest display. “Woof
woof.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Croak?” The frog's lawyer
inquired. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Luna agreed. “Get him
outta here.” Sometimes it wasn't easy to be a reporter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't be like that, crabapple,”
her father consoled. “It's time for you to pack up to go to your
friend's house anyway.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Like Quidditch, Polo wasn't a sport
that Hermione had any interest in. Also like Quidditch, there was no
power on Earth that would stop her from going anyway to show support
for her best friend. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne gasped as her houseguest got
thrown from his horse and landed on the turf with a sickening thud.
“Tough fellow, isn't he?” She commented after the boy got up
immediately and remounted his horse. “Getting up like that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmm?” Hermione didn't drag her
eyes off the game. “That fall was nothing, you should see some of
the situations he gets himself in during a Quidditch game.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bad?” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Sometimes I think they should
ban the bloody sport,” Hermione admitted harshly. “It's bloody
awful. Hardly a game goes by that doesn't end with Harry in the
hospital wing.”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry was in his element, in the thick
of it all. He'd jumped at the chance to experience a friendly game at
the Granger's club, trusting that his previous riding experience
would see him through. Probably a mistake, he admitted to himself as
he remounted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>A flash of white caught his eye and
Harry let his instincts take over. Choking up on the Polo mallet and
slid down till his head was only inches away from the ground. A firm
wack propelled the small wooden ball through the goal posts, scoring
the last point of the game. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good show,” one of his teammates
called out. “But in the future, try not to show off so much.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you mean?” Harry squinted
in the older man's general direction. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The business at the end,” he
replied. “Where you did that fancy riding.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh, that. I wasn't trying to show
off,” Harry replied. “Lost my glasses when I got thrown and I
couldn't see the ball well enough to hit it without getting close.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ah, forgive me then.” He shot the
boy a measured look. “Planning to work on your game during your
stay with the Grangers?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Time permitting,” Harry agreed
cheerfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione sighed in frustration when it
became apparent to her that Harry had no intention of leaving the
field despite his inability to see and potential injuries. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He's going to play without his
glasses?” Anne exclaimed in surprise. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He'd try to keep going if he broke
both his arms,” Hermione said with a frown. “That dummy.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Guess a trip to the optometrist is
in order after this then,” Anne commented. She gave a nod to her
driver, trusting that the burly man would arrange it. “After all,
it's not like you can use magic to fix them.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not during holidays,” Hermione
agreed. “How much longer is this game going to be?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Should be finishing up any time
now,” her mother replied. She smiled as the players dismounted. “A
quick shower and we'll be ready to go.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Did Harry's team win?” Hermione
asked, a bit ashamed to admit that she hadn't been keeping score. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't believe they did,” Anne
replied. “Why?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just wondering,” Hermione said. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione was waiting when Harry and her
father emerged from the locker room a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hope we didn't make you wait long,
darling,” Phil said with a smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You didn't, daddy,” Hermione
replied. “Come on, mum's waiting in the car.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I didn't know we were in a hurry,”
Phil said thoughtfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We need to get Harry some new
glasses,” Hermione said firmly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm fine,” Harry pitched in. He
held up a pair of taped frames. “The tape will hold for now and we
can fix them when we get back to school.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione frowned. “You listen to me,
Harry Potter. You are going to get a new pair of glasses right now
and you're going to like it. It's long past time you got a new pair
of frames.” And she was sick of the other girls saying bad things
about them, needless to say, she kept that last part to herself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's not that I have a problem with
getting new glasses,” Harry said reluctantly. “It's just . . .
well . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just what?”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't really have much money on
me,” Harry protested. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't worry about it,” Phil said
cheerfully. “You're our guest after all.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Still . . .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna looked over the disorganized pile
of junk on her bed with a sense of pure satisfaction. Sometimes it
was best to get everything together before you packed it to make sure
you didn't leave anything behind by mistake. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Father,” she called out. “Where
are the spare tools for the printing press?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“In the ice box,” he called back. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And my portable offset press?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's under your bed,” he replied.
“So is your typewriter.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you father.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's what fathers are for, ragweed.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione was starting to become a bit
unnerved by the way her friend stared blankly out of the window on
the ride back to the house. It was a little creepy, to be honest, not
a word she normally associated with Harry Potter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's wrong, Harry?” She finally
asked, concern coloring her tone. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I can see the leaves,” Harry
whispered in an awe filled voice. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“On that tree.” He pointed down the
motorway. “I can see the leaves from here.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So?” Hermione asked with a
confused frown. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've never been able to see that
well before,” Harry explained. “I always thought everyone was the
same way and that it was impossible to see things far away with that
much detail.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.” A thought occurred. “How do
you see the snitch then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I always look for the sparkle,” he
replied absently. A grin formed on his face. “Draco is in for a big
surprise in our next game.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So . . . getting those glasses was a
good thing then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A great thing,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ms. Jane the librarian was waiting for
them at the front door with a wide smile on her face when they
finally made it home. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thought you'd want to know that a
new box of books arrived earlier today,” Hermione's old governess
reported. “It's in the blue room waiting for you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Ms. Jane,” Hermione
said politely. Unable to restrain herself any longer, the girl darted
down the hall and towards her precious precious treasures intent on
spending the hours until dinner in uninterrupted bliss. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>She was carefully giving the third book
a quick flip through when her best friend slipped into the room with
an odd expression on his face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry carefully locked the door and,
after a few seconds of consideration, calmly propped a chair under
the knob. Long experience with the Dursleys had taught him that
fights may start with the adults but would quickly spread to him. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What are you doing?” Hermione
asked without looking up from her book. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your parents are having a row,”
Harry replied. He carefully considered what else to add to his
barricade. “Thought it might be a good idea to get out of sight.”
Something he thought prudent even if they were nothing like the
Dursleys, never hurt to be careful. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmm?” Hermione looked up from her
book. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your dad said your mum's class was a
feckless drain on society and she replied that bad breeding would
tell,” Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.” Hermione stifled a giggle.
“They're not fighting.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Then what are they doing?”
Harry asked with a raised eyebrow, interested to learn how things
were in normal families, the Dursleys being anything but despite
their attempts to be so. Be hard to find a bigger lot of freaks he
thought to himself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mum and dad met when they were in
University when they took the same politics class.” Hermione
suppressed a smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So their politics were diametrically
opposed and they spent half the class arguing with each other. The
professor got tired of having to listen to it so he made them work on
a project together, they've been together ever since.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sounds like you and Ron,” Harry
joked, having heard more than one of his housemates speculate on the
so called true nature of his two friends' relationship. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mum and dad disagreed on politics,”
Hermione said with a frown, more then a bit sick at the thought of
dating Ron 'Time to Eat' Weasley. “Ron and I disagree on
everything.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Besides, daddy later told me that he
didn't believe most of the things he used to spout off in class. Just
did it to make mum and the other lefties angry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uh.” Harry's eyes crossed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione giggled. “There's no heat in
it, it's just a game they play. Understand?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “I guess.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come over here and sit next to me,”
Hermione demanded. “I've got some new defense books here the you
might want a look at.” They were buried somewhere under the
engineering books, Harry was lucky to have a friend like her that was
thoughtful enough to add reading material that he'd be interested in
to her order, Hermione thought smugly. It was consideration like
that, that had convinced her to reward herself with another dozen
books for Luna and herself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne walked into her husband's office
with a look of profound smugness on her face. Looked as if her little
girl had realized her friend was a boy after all or vice versa. She
wasn't picky. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You'll never guess what I heard from
one of the maids.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Her husband looked up from his papers
to focus his attention on her. “What is it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry took advantage of our . . . er
. . . distraction to sneak into our daughter's room and barricade the
door.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ah.” Phil sighed. “He did, but
not for the reason you're thinking.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why then?” She demanded, a bit put
out that things weren't as juicy as she'd been led to believe they
were. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“From what I gather, his home life
isn't the best.” The man licked his lips, trying to think of the
best way to put things. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So he thought it would be prudent to
get between us and Hermione,” Phil said bluntly. “Just in case.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“In case of . . . oh.” She drooped.
“Well, it just goes to show what a responsible young man he is,”
she said in approval. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm still trying to figure out why
Hermione didn't talk to us about Harry's situation,” Phil
continued. “I wouldn't have even guessed it, one of the footmen had
to tell me.” It was one of the advantages of hiring staff away from
their former employer, they were unusually good at ferreting out the
odd secret. A skill that had come in handy on numerous previous
occasions. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What are you going to do about it?”
Anne asked softly, knowing her husband well enough to know that he
wasn't going to leave things as they were. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well, I had thought to buy the
company the man works for and then fire him.” He smiled coldly.
“Then I would continue to do everything in my power to keep him out
of work if it meant buying every company in England. With the end
result being the bastard starving to death in a ditch somewhere
without a so much as a pence to his name.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How about we give a couple of the
staff a few days off  with a strong suggestion that they spend their
time at Dursley's residence?” Anne asked. A visit Vernon might even
survive even if his ability to eat solid foods did not. “We can do
your way after that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We could,” he agreed. “Or I
could call my brother in law and asking him for a favor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well, he does have a few friends in
the house of lords but other than that, I'm not sure what he can do,
bloody useless fop,” she finished fondly. She loved her brother
dearly, but the man had no sense at all. Seemingly content to spend
his days in idleness and to be even more useless than their father
had been when the had still been active.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Other side,” Phil laughed. “The
judge.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” Anne smiled wickedly. “I
knew there was a reason I married you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yep,” he agreed. “For the
obscenely massive piles of money you gained access to after we
exchanged our vows.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh? I thought it was so I could
pursue my own interests knowing that you had absolutely no desire in
women,” she said as she slid into his lap. “Least that's what
your sister in law said the night before the wedding.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?” he asked dully. <BR><BR>“She
was so angry that I was keeping you from being yourself,” Anne
giggled musically. “She said that she only wanted you to be happy
and that I was denying you that chance by selfishly trapping you in
what would undoubtedly be a loveless marriage.”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“More likely she was angry that I
would retain control over the family money and my heirs after me,”
he replied. “Gold digging bitch.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Divorcing her was the one
intelligent thing your brother ever did,” Anne said
sympathetically. “Not that he isn't a perfectly lovely man, it's
just . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He's a bit too much like your
brother? Interested in wine, women, and more wine.” Well, publicly
anyway. He absolutely hated keeping things from his wife but there
were some things best kept as quiet as possible. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Exactly,” she agreed. “The older
one anyway, Jack is a bit better, just lazy.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He still working as a repairman?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” she sighed. “He has so
much potential too, if only he'd apply himself to something.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>It was the biggest scandal that had
rocked their family in centuries, someone of the blood doing
something so hopelessly common. The only thing that barely excused
it, so far as the less pleasant members of her family were concerned,
was the fact that he'd been born on the wrong side of the sheets.
Didn't he know that he was supposed to live on his remittence rather
than doing something so common? Her step mother had whispered that it
was proof that even the most noble of blood wasn't always able to
overcome the common sort every chance she got. The day she'd seen the
back of that woman for the last time was one of her fonder memories. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil was forcibly awakened early by a
loud pounding on the door of his bedchamber. Holidays were supposed
to be relaxing, times when you could laze around in bed until noon,
he lamented to himself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Go see what Hermione wants,” his
wife muttered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How do you know it's Hermione?” he
rejoindered.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Who else would could it be? Harry
wouldn't think to bother us and the staff would have come in if they
thought it was important enough to disturb us,” she replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That does not explain why should I
be the one to go see what she wants?” he pointed out calmly as the
pounding continued, the spaces between the knocks getting shorter and
shorter as their daughter's patience grew thinner and thinner. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Because I'm asleep and you're much
too considerate to disturb me,” she said reasonably. “Snore,
snore,” she added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I blame this on your father for
spoiling you so much when you were a child,” he said
conversationally as he shrugged into his bathrobe. “I'm going to
have to have words with him at our next meeting.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Remember to mention the fact that he
could have shipped me off to one of those dreadful boarding schools
like my step mother suggested rather than hiring private tutors,”
she suggested with a yawn. “It was always a sore point with her
that I was around to make it difficult to syphon off more than she
did.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil yawned as he walked across the
room and opened the door. The knocks sounding like machine gun fire
at that point. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, darling?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We need to get Luna today,”
Hermione explained cheerfully, looking as if she had not in fact
spent the previous few minutes pounding on her parents' bedroom door.
“Mum said she wanted to wake up early so we could have breakfast
together in London.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think she meant early, not still
dark outside,” Phil said thoughtfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The sun's been out for almost six
minutes, daddy,” Hermione giggled. “I didn't start knocking till
it was out you know.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course it has, six whole minutes,
silly me,” he sighed. “It's for you, dear.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I heard,” Anne called back. She
made eye-contact with her daughter. “Wait downstairs, darling. I'll
be with you shortly.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay, mum,” Hermione agreed. “I
can't wait for you to meet Luna,” she added before happily skipping
down the stairs. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Our daughter is skipping,” Phil
reported, trying and failing to remember the last time he'd seen his
baby girl do that. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's nice to see her so excited
about something,” Anne replied. “Also good to confirm that she's
got at least one close female friend.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just be sure not to say that the
girl is scruffy,” he said seriously. “You know how that turned
out the last time.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How could I forget,” she laughed.
“How do I look?” She twirled around. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ravishing.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mind doing me a favor?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Knowing you? Quite possibly. What do
you want?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Could you take Harry to the bank and
make a quick check of his accounts? Hermione was worried about them.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I am going to to the club today and
after that I'm going to the bank. I've been meaning to open an
account for Hermione so she has a bit of pocket money when she's at
school. If Harry wishes to come along with me the I would be happy to
have the company.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And also happy to give a bit of
unsolicited advice,” Anne added. “Please.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, dear.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not at all. Off with you, wouldn't
want to keep our daughter waiting.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No telling what sort of ideas she'll
get,” she agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil took his time getting showed and
dressed and was more then a bit surprised to find his house guest
waiting for him in the sitting room when he finally emerged. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione wake you up too?” he
asked sympathetically. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, sir. I was already up.”<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wake up early then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Haven't managed to break the habit
yet,” Harry admitted. It had only been fear of getting lost in the
giant house that had kept him in his room so long the first day. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You'll get the hang of it some day,
I'm sure.” Phil grinned. “I'm going to London today, would you
care to accompany me?” 
</P>
<P><BR>“I don't want to be a bother,”
Harry said quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You won't be,” Phil promised. “I'd
consider it a favor if you did accompany me since I always have a
bloody time of finding the entrance to Diagon Alley if Hermione isn't
along.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're going to Diagon Alley?”
Harry asked in surprise. 
</P>
<P><BR>“To the bank, yes. I have some
business to do there, wouldn't mind a chance to poke around the shops
without Hermione dragging me towards the book store either.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Harry agreed. “I'd be
happy to come, sir. Thank you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Excellent, glad to have you with me.
Just please, remember it's Phil, not sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay, Phil. I'll try to remember.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good. Have you eaten yet, Harry?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not yet.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We'll eat at the club then.” Phil
decided. “Come along, Harry. The car should be out front.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne paid the restaurant staff no
notice as they bustled around the table. Choosing instead to focus on
her daughter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where and when are we supposed to
meet your friend, darling?” the woman asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna said she'd meet us at Kings
Cross station around ten,” Hermione replied, oblivious to the fact
that the a portion of the security team had detached itself from the
main group to make their preparations.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Does she have any special needs we
need to be aware of?” Anne continued. “Dietary requirements, that
sort of thing.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, mum. She's just a little
strange,” Hermione said, sipping her tea. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“In what way?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She likes to believe in animals that
don't exist,” Hermione explained. “I think her dorm-mates like to
pick on her because of it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But she's a very nice girl,”
Hermione hastened to add. “And she's very smart.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm glad you've got at least one
female friend,” Anne said with a soft smile, repeating her earlier
words to her husband. “Wouldn't want to risk poor Harry to get
jealous if all you had was boys, would we?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mum!”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne giggled at the expression on her
daughter's face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The car pulled up to the curb and Phil
Granger's imposing driver stepped out, eyes scanning for threats.
Assured that there were no immediate dangers, the man opened the door
and stepped aside to allow his patron to step out of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come along, Harry,” Phil said as
they exited the car. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where are we going, sir?” Harry
asked politely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione's father made a face. “I
thought I told you to call me Phil?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sorry. It's a hard habit to break.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't worry about it.” Phil waved
his hand at an impressive stone building. “We're going to my club
for a bit to meet with someone.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The Diogenes Club,” Harry read the
plaque on side of the building.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Be sure not to speak with or look at
anyone,” Phil said firmly. “Not until I say it's alright to
anyway.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Club rules,” Phil explained.
“Keeps the atmosphere relaxed.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry followed the man up the steps and
to the front door which was opened by a man in livery just as they
arrived. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“New member, sir?” The door man
asked with a laugh. 
</P>
<P><BR>“I'm thinking of sponsoring him
in a few years,” Phil agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The doorman's smile vanished and he
took a moment to examine Harry. “I look forward to hearing your
reasons, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I look forward to giving them,” he
returned. He stepped into the building. “This way, Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry kept his mouth firmly closed even
as his eyes widened in astonishment at the rich furnishings and
ornate decorations. After going through a maze of halls, up a flight
of stairs and down several more 
</P>
<P>until they finally came to a stop in
front of a thick oak door.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You can talk now, Harry,” Phil
told the boy. “Follow me.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry followed Hermione's father
through the doorway and into a small room, bare save for a woman
sitting behind a desk next to another large door. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good afternoon, Sir.” The woman's
right hand disappeared below the desk. “What can I do for you
today?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is 'M' in?” Phil asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Who may I say is asking for him,
sir?” the woman ignored the question.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry stepped to one side and edged a
hand towards his wand due to the slight tightening in the woman's
posture which indicated that trouble is on the way. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Philip Granger. That's Philip with a
P, not an F.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Yes, sir.” The woman relaxed
and her right hand reappeared. “Sorry for not recognizing you,
sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not at all,” Phil said calmly.
“Well?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Go right in, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil crossed the room and threw open
the door. As Harry followed, he noticed a name on the door, the
letters faded with time. 'Mycroft Holmes,' he read silently. Why in
the devil did that sound so familiar. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The office they went into was much
richer then the first one. Thick Persian carpets covered the floor
and Harry a man that Harry faintly recognized sat behind the desk. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Got a new pair of glasses, did
you?” the man asked with an easy grin. “Look forward to seeing
how it affects your game.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Still need to practice before I can
take advantage of my better sight, sir,” Harry replied cheerfully,
finally placing the man as one of his teammates in the Polo Game. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not that it isn't always a pleasure,
but what prompted the visit, Philip?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Problem dealing with security,”
Phil replied, taking a seat and waving for Harry to do the same. “You
know where my daughter goes to school?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I am aware,” the man agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Happen to know where I can find some
of that sort of security? 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Afraid the ones we've got are all
tied up,” the man said regretfully. “I also imagine that your
house guest could round some up though.” He'd been more than a bit
surprised by the contents of the boy's file. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil shot Harry a curious look. “What
do you mean by that?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You mean you don't know?” The man
hit a button on his desk to activate his intercom. “Hold all calls
and meetings.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>“Yes, sir,” his
secretary's voice agreed.

</P>
<P>Luna was bouncing up and down in
excitement as she waited for her friend to appear. The fact that she
had a friend gave her a warm feeling in the pit of her spleen that
quickly spread to fill the rest of her body. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Did you forget anything, crabapple?”
her father asked helpfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Loads of things,” Luna agreed.
“That way I wouldn't forget anything important.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Her father nodded, sounded logical to
him. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>A flash of bushy hair caught Luna's
attention and a she quickly confirmed that her friend had arrived. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione,” Luna squealed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna,” Hermione replied as she
rushed over. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The two girls began chattering
excitedly in an incomprehensible technobabble.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you understand any of that?”
Luna's father ventured cautiously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not a word,” Anne replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Good,” he sighed in relief. “I
thought I was the only one. Larry Lovegood.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Anne Granger,” she introduced
herself. “Pleasure.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pleasure is all mine,” Larry said
quickly. His eyes shifted to the menacing looking figures that had
surrounded their little gathering. “They with you?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I need someone to carry the heavy
things for us after we go shopping later,” Anne joked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh, right. Forgot you couldn't use
charms to make things easier,” Larry said, accepting the woman's
explanation. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry was shocked when they were
immediately met by an important looking goblin upon their entrance to
Gringotts. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mr. Granger, a pleasure to see you
again.” the goblin said with a show of pointed teeth. “What can
Gringotts do for you today?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for seeing us so soon,
Hooktooth,” Phil greeted the goblin. “I'd like to establish an
account for my daughter and Harry would like a statement, if that's
not too much trouble.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not at all,” Hooktooth replied.
“Why don't I show you to the lounge while we get the paperwork
together.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you,” Phil said graciously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The goblin took them to a richly
carpeted room and directed them to sit in two lush looking chairs. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Please help yourselves to anything
in the room with the management's compliments,” Hooktooth said
politely. “The paperwork should already be on the table next to
you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Here it is,” Phil agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It shall take us a few minutes to do
a quick audit of Mr. Potter's vault,” the goblin said respectfully.
And to make a quick notation in the boy's file to insure he got a
high level of service. Wouldn't do to offend someone with such
powerful friends. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We aren't in any hurry,” Phil
assured the goblin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then I shall take my leave, please
pull the bell cord if you need anything,” Hooktooth said as he took
his leave.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The Lovegoods' eyes were wide in
fascination as they stared at the scenery through the car windows.
Every second brought something new and exciting. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I never realized the muggle world
was so complicated,” Luna admitted. The little blonde was a bit
intimidated by the size of everything. “None of my muggle studies
books said it was anything like this.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Purebloods,” Hermione snorted. A
contrite look immediately appeared on her face. “I'm sorry, Luna, I
didn't mean any offense by that.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“None taken,” Luna's father
murmured. “It's a well known fact that there isn't a pureblood
alive that has  enough common sense to fill a tea spoon.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where are we going for lunch, mum?”
Hermione asked, desperately trying to change the subject. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Marvelous place Thomas showed me
over on the East End,” Anne replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think you'll like it, Ms.
Hermione,” the large driver rumbled from the front seat. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil and Harry broke off their
conversation when the door to the room opened to admit the oddly
polite goblin that had shown them in earlier. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The preliminary audit of Mr.
Potter's accounts has been completed,” Hooktooth announced as he
entered the room. “The board asked me to again express their thanks
for the help you've given us.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Please tell the board that I'll
always be happy to turn a profit,” Phil said formally. “The
occasions that I'm able to help others make profit as well, I
consider myself doubly blessed.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I shall pass your words back to my
superiors,” Hooktooth agreed.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mind if I get my business out of the
way first, Harry?” Phil asked. “Won't take but a minute.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No problem, Mr. Granger,” Harry
said quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Have you decided how much you'd like
to put into your daughter's account, Mr. Granger?” Hooktooth asked.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not much, only about five hundred
thousand Galleons,” he replied. “Please tell me if she runs
through it and please extend credit if she needs it.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, Mr. Granger,” the
goblin agreed quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Needs, not wants,” he cautioned.
“I want her taken care of if there's an emergency in the same way I
want her to get my permission before she decides to buy out every
bookstore in the country.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We will see to it, Mr. Granger,”
the goblin assured his customer. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've already filled out the
paperwork,” Phil said. “Don't believe there was any other
business I needed to take care of.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mr. Potter has five hundred and
forty thousand two hundred and fifteen galleons, two thousand and
thirteen sickles, and five hundred and twelve knuts. In addition to
that, he has three sets of silver, two gold cups, twelve silver cups,
fifteen golden rings, six emeralds, twenty uncut diamonds, fifteen
ounces of gold dust, two thousand dollars in  American gold eagles,
two hundred dollars in American silver coin, ten thousand dollars of
American currency, two thousand Canadian dollars in mixed silver and
gold coin, three thousand pounds in gold coin, one hundred thousand
Swiss Francs in mixed gold and silver coin, five thousand French
francs in silver coin, five hundred dutch guilders in silver coin,
one Wilkinson motorbike, fifteen cases of scotch, twelve of gin, and
thirteen of rum. Plus three sealed chests, two sealed file cabinets,
and assorted closed bags.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Was that the face value of the coins
or the gold and silver value?” Phil asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Face value,” Hooktooth replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Any idea why there's so much foreign
currency in Harry's account?” Phil asked, noticing the confused
look on the boy's face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's rumored that the Potter family
made most of it's fortune sneaking alcohol into the United States
during their 'great experiment' and a bit more of it sneaking things
into and out of the continent during the last muggle war. Gringotts
has no evidence that any laws were broken and thus has no obligation
to investigate or to report anything to the Ministry,” the goblin
added with a toothy grin. “We value our customer's confidentiality
more than we value our relationship with the current and every past
magical government. Something the current magical government has
publicly complained about on numerous occasions.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you,” Phil laughed.
“Wonderful story about your family, Harry. Wish mine were half as
good, you don't want to know what we made the bulk of our family
fortune on.”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?” Harry asked automatically. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Guano,” Phil said with a sour look
on his face. “Disgusting stuff, even more disgusting was how they
mined a lot of it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.” He made a mental note to ask
Hermione about it later. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you mind too terribly letting
us use the floo on the way out?” Phil asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course not,” Hooktooth said
quickly. “This way, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>They stopped in front of a large stone
fire place and Phil carefully threw a pinch of powder into the fire. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Department of Magical Law
Enforcement,” he called out. “I hate these things,” Phil
murmured as he bent down. What followed was a hurried conversation
with someone on the other end. “They'd like to speak with you,
Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay.” Harry took the man's place
and finished the conversation two minutes later. “Guess they're not
too busy today, we've got an appointment right now if we want it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hooktooth escorted the two humans to
the banks exit and  waited until they were out of sight. Then, in a
quick walk, he disappeared through one of the side doors intent on
reaching his manager's office as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>To his considerable surprise, he was
intercepted and taken deeper and deeper into the bowels of the bank
to thick bronze door behind which could only be one goblin, the Clan
Chief himself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hooktooth's escort threw open the doors
and led the goblin through a rich waiting room to a large steel door.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wait here,” the escort ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hooktooth didn't even have time to
agree before his escort disappeared. Minutes later, the large doors
opened to reveal what was within. The walls were covered in
functional and well used weapons covering every era of goblin combat.
From the axes and swords of ancient times to the SMLE and the Lewis,
of the last, most successful revolt. At the center of the room was a
middle aged goblin sitting behind a heavy oak desk. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come in,” the goblin ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir,” Hooktooth agreed. He
marched in and stopped four paces in front of the desk in a rigid
attention. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Report,” the goblin barked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sir, the Granger wished me to pass
on his regards. He told me that he was always happy to turn a profit
and was doubly blessed when he was able to turn a profit for others
at the same time,” Hooktooth said quickly. “He came to open a
vault for the younger Granger.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How much did he put into it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Five hundred thousand galleons,”
Hooktooth said immediately. “Attached to an unlimited line of
credit if there is an emergency, though we are to contact the elder
Granger for approval if there is not.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Testing his progeny?” the goblin
mused. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Possibly, sir,” Hooktooth replied.
“It may have just been an expense account.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pass any duties you may have that
could come into conflict with your service to the Granger family. I
want you to focus on them and I want you to keep me apprised on what
is happening through Sub-chief Bloodrot. See that he knows everything
the younger Granger chooses to do with the account and every other
scrap of information you come across regarding the Granger family or
the Potter,” the goblin ordered. “I want you to also be sure that
the counter drones know that the younger Granger is to be treated
with the same amount of respect accorded to her sire. Emphasis how
displeased I will be with them personally if they forget their
place.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir,” Hooktooth agreed.
“Should I do the same with the Potter?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I am sure that you are already
aware, sir, but the Granger was accompanied by the last Potter.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I am. Were you able to find out
why?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm told the last Potter is a close
companion of the younger Granger,” Hooktooth said quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Keep an eye on that one too then,”
the Chief said after a moment of thought. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I will, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Was there anything else?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Dismissed.” 
</P>
<P><BR>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Amelia was in the middle of a rather
large stack of paperwork when her assistant threw open the door and
barged in without warning. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” Amelia demanded, more
then a bit annoyed at the interruption. “It had better be bloody
important. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry Potter to see you, ma'am,”
the star-struck assistant said quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Show him in,” Amelia ordered,
slightly confused by the visit. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>A few minutes later, the savior of the
wizarding world, The-Boy-Who-Lived himself arrived with an unfamiliar
man in tow. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for seeing me, Madame
Bones,” Harry said politely. “I understand how busy your schedule
must be.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just what was so important that you
needed to see me immediately?” Amelia asked, barely keeping her
temper under control at the thought that she'd been interrupted for
something that wasn't of vital importance. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“When we flooed , your assistant told
us to come over to meet with you right away, Madame Bones,” Harry
replied quickly, hoping to defuse the woman. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see,” Amelia sighed, her anger
disappearing in a flash. “Have a seat.” She waited until her
visitors had made themselves comfortable. “What can I do for you,
Mister Potter?” Wasn't the boy's fault her normally level headed
assistant was a bit of a fangirl. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“As I said before, I flooed your
office to ask if you had a list of . . . uh . . . ” Harry looked
over at Hermione's father. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Private security contractors,”
Phil supplied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your assistant said that I should
have a talk with you,” Harry said politely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” Amelia leaned back in her
chair and rubbed her temple. “Short answer is, there aren't any.
Would you like the long answer?” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Please,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I know of a couple dozen ex-Aurors
that would be happy for the work if you don't mind muggle-borns and
half-bloods.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't mind them at all, Madame
Bones,” Harry replied. In fact, he preferred them, less chance
they'd be tied to the Pureblood factions. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What would you like in return?”
Phil asked smoothly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you mean by that?” Amelia
snapped. 
</P>
<P><BR>“I'm not asking if you'd like a
bribe,” Phil laughed, happy to see a bit of honesty in what his
sources had informed him was a pit of corruption. “I'm asking if
there is anything either of us can do to return the favor?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sorry, it's just working around here
you get used to people expecting you to act a certain way.” Amelia
pursed her lips. “We're doing a benefit for disabled Aurors,
widows, and orphans in a few months, an appearance by Mr. Potter
would help us meet our goal.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If I can get the time off school,”
Harry agreed, happy that he could do something to repay his host.
“And so long as I wouldn't have to stay too long.” He blushed. “I
. . . I really don't like crowds,” he admitted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't either,” Amelia said with
a tight smile. “I'll be in touch.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for your time, Madame
Bones.” Phil said, raising to his feet. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sorry for the mix up,” Harry
added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Got me away from my paperwork,”
Amelia said with a shrug. “Something that's rarely a bad thing.
Have a good day.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>They left the office and were half way
out of the Ministry when Harry heard a familiar voice calling his
name. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Neville!” Harry called back. “What
are you doing here?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Gran is talking to one of the
Politicians,” Neville explained. “You?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Meeting with Madame Bones,” Harry
replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil Granger stepped into the
background to allow the two boys a bit of time to themselves and was
joined a few minutes later by an elderly woman. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hadn't realized my Neville was
such good friends with The-Boy-Who-Lived,” the old woman said
happily. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Philip Granger,” he introduced
himself. “Hermione Granger's father and Harry's host for the
Holidays.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Dame Augusta Longbottom,” she
introduced herself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Dame Longbottom.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The pleasure is mine, Mister
Granger.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Gran, can Harry come to the party?”
Neville asked excitedly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Augusta agreed. Happy
that hers was the first invitation that the Potter accepted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry nudged Neville with his elbow
causing the other boy to blush a deep red. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uh, he's with Hermione and Luna this
winter so . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So of course three invitations will
be delivered to your three guests,” Augusta said smoothly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Gran.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, Neville.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I would be happy to extend another
for yourself and your wife, Mister Granger.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Dame Longbottom,” Phil
said quickly. “Why don't we let the boys have a bit of time to
themselves?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Augusta made a snap decision. “Neville,
we'll just be down the hall if you need us.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay, Gran,” Neville agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The two adults walked off to gain a bit
of privacy. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What can I do for you, Mister
Granger?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm afraid that our invitation will
need to include a few members of our staff,” Phil said with a look
of embarrassment. “I hate to impose like this.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I trust that they are aware of the
fact that magic is real?” Augusta asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” Phil agreed. “Again, I'm
terribly sorry to impose like this, but there are security concerns
that I can't ignore.” Wasn't permitted to ignore, the more service
he gave his country the more restrictions were placed on his life. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was told that you and your wife
are dentists?” Augusta asked with a raised eyebrow, wondering what
other information might be missing from her files.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My wife is a practicing dentist,”
Phil agreed. “I dabble a bit, mostly assisting her or doing
charity, but unfortunately most of my time is taken up dealing with
other business these days.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” The old woman considered
the man for a moment. “Please consider your staff included in the
invitation.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you for your consideration,
Dame Longbottom.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Think nothing of it, Mister
Granger.”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione frowned in confusion when the
car took an unexpected turn away from the route that would take them
back to her weekend house. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Are we going to the London House,
mum?” she asked cautiously.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We're making a quick stop before we
head home,” Anne said calmly. “Thomas suggested it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Figured you and your friend might
enjoy a quick peek before we go back” the big man rumbled. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where are we going, mum?” Hermione
asked curiously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Covent Garden, I thought you girls
might want to get a look at the trains on display at the Transport
Museum.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You hear that, Luna?” Hermione
squealed in excitement. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I did, Hermione,” Luna agreed.
“Shame we couldn't bring Harry with us.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“This is just a short visit,” Anne
pointed out. “You can bring him along later, when we have the time
for a proper look around.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, mum,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry and Phil left the bookshop at
Diagon Alley laden with packages. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thanks for letting me make a couple
quick stops,” Harry said gratefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No problem, Harry,” Phil replied.
“Still want to make a stop at a normal bookstore on the way back?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If it isn't too much trouble,”
Harry agreed. “Unless of course, you've already picked up a bunch
of engineering manuals for Hermione and Luna.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Christmas shopping?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's my first real Christmas,”
Harry said simply. Spent with a family and outside of the school, as
it was supposed to be. “I want to make it special.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We've got about four hours before we
need to be back,” Phil said after a quick glance at his watch.
“Leaves us an hour or two for shopping.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hope it doesn't take that long,”
Harry said quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Spoken like a true man,” Phil
laughed. They walked through the Cauldron and stepped into the
waiting car. “Excuse me for a moment, Harry,” Phil said as he
opened a compartment and pulled out a handset. “I need to make a
quick call.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's me,” Phil said into the
phone. “Did you get my fax? So soon? Good. Buy it and keep an eye
out for more of them. Pulled up the rails huh? Put an option on it.
What's your other idea? Get a list, put the ones in Scotland and near
my house near the top. Good. Good. Really? Good. I'll talk to you
later.” He hung up the phone and carefully closed the compartment.
“Sorry about that, Harry.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No problem, I know how it can be
sometimes.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What did you have in mind?” Phil
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sir?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“For the girls, what did you want to
get them?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Figured I'd get a couple engineering
texts for Hermione,” Harry replied. “Don't know what for Luna.
Was hoping that I could find something in Diagon.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Between them, Hermione and Luna managed
to produce several pages of notes in the short time they were in the
museum and the girls spent much of the ride home chattering excitedly
about what they'd learned. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Could you drop us off at father's
garage?” Hermione requested politely as they pulled onto the family
lands. “I wanna show Luna the car father's building with me.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No problem, Ms. Hermione,” the
large driver agreed after receiving a discrete nod from the girl's
mother.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Thomas,” the girl said
politely. Hermione turned back to her friend. “Father is also
letting me keep Harry's motorcycle collection there.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How wonderful,” Luna said with a
smile. The car pulled out of a stand of trees, allowing Luna her
first look at the impressive Granger residence. “It's very large,”
Luna mumbled in shock.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My great-great-great-Grandfather
wanted to show off,” Hermione sniffed at the thought of someone
being so vain. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's no worse then what your
ancestors on the other side did, darling,” Anne laughed, thinking
of some of the monstrosity that was her family's ancestral home. “You
must remember to judge people by the standards of their day, darling,
not your own.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, mum,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil turned to Harry as the car pulled
to a stop in front of the stately Granger residence. “I'll go
distract the girls, you get everything hidden in your room.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Give me fifteen minutes,” Phil
said as he got out of the car. “Help him with the things, James.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir,” the driver agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil found the girls tinkering with a
motorcycle in his garage. “Hello girls,” he said, announcing
himself. “Keeping busy?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Daddy,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Mr. Granger,” Luna said
shyly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Call me Phil,” he said with a
smile. “I . . .” he froze. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is there something wrong, Daddy?”
Hermione asked, worried at his sudden change in demeanor. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you know what this is?” Phil
gasped, staring at the bike in shocked wonder. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, Daddy?” Hermione
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a Vincent Black Prince,” Phil
said in awe. “One of Harry's?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Daddy,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Why don't you show me the rest
of his collection,” Phil suggested, voice catching. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We've only got maybe a third of it
put back together,” Hermione warned as she led him to the part of
the garage she'd commandeered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil was dumbstruck, before him were
rows upon rows of carefully assembled classic motorcycles. To think
he'd hoped the boy would have one interesting piece in his
collection. What lay before him exceeded even his wildest dreams. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm gonna need to contact someone I
know about this,” Phil mumbled half to to himself as his mind began
to catalogue some of the other treasures.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why's that, daddy?” Hermione
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Because the value of this may dwarf
what Harry already has in his vault,” Phil replied. “The Vincent
alone is worth . . .” he shook his head. “Tell me if he decides
to sell any of this, I'm not normally interested in Motorbikes but
I'd be prepared to make an exception for some of this.” To rob his
favorite brother in law of the chance to purchase them if for no
other reason. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright, daddy,” Hermione agreed.
“Just so you know, I don't think Harry will be interested in
selling any of this.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's fine, darling.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is it really that valuable?” Luna
asked shyly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think so,” Phil agreed. “It's
not really my field, but they sell motorcycles at some of the
auctions I attend so I do have some idea.” He shook his head in
shock. “When you'd told me Harry had a motorcycle collection, I'd
assumed . . . well, I don't know what I'd assumed but I surely didn't
expect something like this.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Could you teach us how to ride,
daddy?” Hermione asked sweetly and in full knowledge that she had
her father wrapped around her finger. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You want to ride?” he stared at
his daughter in shock. It had been surprising enough to find out that
his little girl had taken an interest in mechanics. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think Harry would,” Hermione
replied. “I'd like to at least try it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So would I,” Luna agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll see to it, darling,” he
agreed. Phil made a mental note to pick up a couple disposable bikes
for the lesson. Knowing what a crime it would be a crime to let one
of Harry's classics get damaged by a beginner's mistake even with
magic to make it better. 
</P>
<P><BR>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne caught Harry as he was walking
through the front door with the purchases he'd made in Diagon Alley
and later at a more mundane bookshop. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Christmas Presents?” she asked
dryly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Mrs. Granger,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>

<P>“Take the bags from him and make sure
they're hidden where my daughter and her guest can't find them,”
Anne shot an order at one of the maids. “An owl delivered an
envelope for you, Harry. It's in the study.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Probably Neville's invitation,”
Harry replied. “There should be one for you too.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>In a daze, Phil stumbled back into the
house and collapsed into his favorite chair. The Vincent had been
just the tip of what he now believed would turn out to be one of the
better collections of classic motorbikes in the country. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Under my nose the whole time and I
didn't even know it,” he mumbled to himself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Something wrong, sir?” the butler
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sorry?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I asked if there was something
wrong, sir,” the butler repeated. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ah, no. I hadn't realized the extent
of Harry's motorbike collection until I had a chance to see it for
myself,” Phil said with a laugh. “Please remind me to get someone
in to appraise it and remind me to see that it gets insured before
the end of the hollidays.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I will, sir,” the butler agreed.
“Your wife asked me to find you, sir. She wants to have a word
about the invitation you accepted earlier today.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“A good word, or a bad one?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I wouldn't care to guess, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Of course you wouldn't,” Phil
sighed. “Do you happen know where she is right now?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“In the study with young Mister
Harry,” the butler replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you.” Phil rose to his feet.
“Best go see what she wants.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've found it best not to put these
things off, sir,” the butler agreed with a grin. “James and
Thomas would like a word after your wife is finished with you, sir.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Tell them that should I survive,
I'll meet with them in my office.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I shall, good luck, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>When he found her, his wife had an
expression of extreme annoyance on her face.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What have I done now?” he asked
calmly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Two days doesn't give me a lot of
time to prepare for a social event,” she said with a frown.
“Especially not our debut in magical society.”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hadn't realized it was so soon,”
Phil admitted contritely. “Sorry about that, dear. I'd have been
sure to call ahead if I had known.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's no big deal,” Anne said with
a wave. “Just means we don't have much time to get Hermione and
Luna's dresses made.” The woman had been more then a bit relieved
to learn that Harry's wardrobe had already taken care of. She'd also
been more than a bit impressed by the extent of it, the boy had
everything from evening ware to traditional highland dress. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You've already called your dress
maker then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Anne agreed. “Why?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Because you might have asked the
girls first,” Phil pointed out. “For all we know they might want
to wear formal robes.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“You're right,” Anne sighed.
“They're in the garage aren't they?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Should be,” Phil agreed. “It's
where they were a couple minutes ago anyway.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne found the two girls after a couple
minutes of searching and was a bit put out by her daughter's admitted
ignorance of the matter. She'd told the girl more than once how
important it was to at least have some idea of what to wear for a
formal event. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't know,” Hermione admitted.
“I don't really pay too much attention to that sort of thing.” To
be quite frank, she didn't see what the big deal was. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Darling, your social position means
that you have to know these things,” Anne chided gently. “You're
going to have to learn these things some day.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmph,” Hermione sniffed in mock
disdain. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Either one will be fine,” Luna
offered shyly after it became clear that Hermione had nothing more to
add. “In fact, a dress might be better if the level of quality is
high enough.” For a party hosted by the Longbottoms anyway. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Luna,” Anne said with a
smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I am happy to help, Anne,” Luna
replied, basking in the approval. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>James made a show of handing Thomas a
couple coins when Phil entered his his office to meet with them. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What was that all about?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just a little wager,” James
explained. “Didn't believe you'd get here in one piece, Thomas
figured your low class background would see you through.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What low class background?” Phil
laughed. “Eton followed by Cambridge.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” James agreed. “But you
aren't any sort of Lord, Ms. Anne says that makes you a frightfully
low class commoner.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Must be feeling frisky tonight if
she asked you to put on that show,” Phil said eagerly. “Enough
fun, what did you two want to speak with me about?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Few names on the list you gave us
stood out. Got a couple retired Constables, one guy I knew in the
Regiment that was a green grocer last I heard, and a couple that work
for your friend at the club.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wonder if he knows about them?”
Phil said thoughtfully. “You want to hire them?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Be nice,” James agreed. “Also
like your permission to talk to a couple people Mr. Harry mentioned.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You don't mind werewolves, do you,
Mr. Granger?” Thomas asked with a grin. “Mister Harry says that
he's an okay blokes that are only out of it a few nights a month.
Promises that we aren't in any danger if we take precautions.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're joking?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Afraid not, sir,” Thomas replied.
“We'll need a secure room for him to lock himself in a few nights a
month if you give the go ahead.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hired you two because you had good
judgement, not because I wanted you to come to me every time you had
a decision to make,” Phil told them with a grin. Use your
judgement.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir,” James agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I thought he hired us because we
were a couple strapping young lads that were easy on the eyes,”
Thomas whispered loudly. “Least, that's what his ex-sister in law
told us.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a good thing that Mrs. Granger
is understanding about these sorts of things,” James agreed. “Still
a shame she's keeping him from living openly though.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The more I hear about that gold
digging bitch, the gladder I am that my idiot brother divorced her,”
Phil sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We might have had a few contingency
plans in place if he didn't,” James admitted happily. “There's a
reason the other servants were so attentive every time she came to
the house and why Ms. Hermione was always taking a nap and not to be
disturbed whenever that bitch wanted to see her.” Ms. Jane had only
had to get nasty about it once, not even the bitch had been stupid
enough to try to push things a second time. It was a pity in a way,
there would been no chance of her trying anything a third time if she
had.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Fortunately, that never had to
happen,” Thomas said in relief. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Dare I ask?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Probably best if you didn't, sir.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna took the seat next to Hermione who
in turn was seated in her customary spot next to Harry and across
from her parents as they sat down at the table and did her best to
ape the other girl's movements so as to fit in, in the unfamiliar
setting.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna,” Anne called out with a
smile. “Hermione isn't the best one to copy. Her knowledge of
etiquette wouldn't fill a thimble.”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna looked down at her pate with a
deep blush. “Oh.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't be embarrassed, dear. You're
doing things exactly the way you're supposed to in an unfamiliar
situation. I just thought I'd give you a small warning before you
picked up any of my daughter's many bad habits.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I still say that none of that
matters,” Hermione insisted, chin going up. “It's not like I'm
going to go to any of your social events. Those fancy rituals of
yours are just ways to set yourself apart from the other classes.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil's booming laugh echoed throughout
the room. “Wonderful argument, darling. I recall your mother making
a similar argument when-” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hush,” Anne cut him off, a deep
blush adorned the woman's face as she remembered the incident that
had resulted in their only daughter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mum?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I agree with you to some extent,
darling.” Anne gave an impish smile. “Just be aware of how much
of an asset it can be to fit into whatever society you're in.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, mum,” Hermione agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne gave a satisfied nod before
turning to her newest guest. “So, Luna, Hermione tells me that your
family is in the newspaper business.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Since seventeen sixty nine when my
ancestor started printing broadsides,” Luna said, resisting the
urge to look down at her lap. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Do you happen to know how much your
father charges for advertising space?” Phil asked absently.
“Because I-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No business at the table,” Anne
cut him off. “Sorry, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I do,” Luna agreed. “We can
discuss rates later if you like.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry kept silent throughout the meal,
choosing instead to observe his dining companions and to listen to
the conversations happening around him. So this is what a normal
family is like, he marveled. Before Luna arrived, he hadn't been able
to sit back and take it all in and, as much as he cared for them, the
Weasleys could never be considered 'normal.' 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>'Would this be what his parents would
have been like?' Harry wondered to himself. 'Would his family have
sat around the table seamlessly shifting from conversation to
conversation?' Another reason to curse Voldemort, he concluded to
himself as the meal came to a close. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne caught her husband's eyes and
slowly licked her lips. “I'm going to sleep,” she announced. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll join you,” Phil said with a
smile of anticipation. “Good night, Harry, girls.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good night, daddy,” Hermione
replied automatically. “Come on, Luna, you're sharing my room.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright, Hermione,” Luna agreed,
allowing herself to be dragged out of the room. “Good night,
Harry,” she called over her shoulder. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good night,” Harry said to the now
empty room. He nodded to the maids as they began clearing the table,
treasuring every moment of his holiday at the Granger home. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil was unsurprised to find that Harry
had already awoken and eaten when he finally managed to pull himself
out of bed. The short time he'd known the boy had already
familiarized him with his young guest's habits. A frown appeared on
the man's face, really needed to speak to his brother in law to see
how things were progressing. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Morning, Phil,” Harry said
cheerfully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry.” Phil grinned. “Ever play
golf?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, sir.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you care to learn?” Phil
asked hopefully. “The girls will be busy getting their dresses
fitted so I figured it would be best to get out of the house.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Harry agreed. “When do we
leave?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How about now?” Phil suggested.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione had to drag herself out of bed
the next morning. Having been up half the night chatting with Luna,
waking up was a chore. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm sorry, did I wake you?” Luna's
chirped. “I've tried to be quiet.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How long have you been up, Luna?”
Hermione demanded. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I slept in a bit,” Luna admitted
guiltily. “So, five or so hours.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's ten o'clock now,” Hermione
groaned. “When did we go to sleep last night?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Half past one,” Luna happily
supplied the answer. “Which is why I allowed myself to sleep in, I
don't usually stay up so late.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Have you had breakfast yet?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was afraid to leave the room,”
Luna admitted. “I know I'd get lost in this giant house of yours.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good one, Luna,” Hermione giggled.
“Come on, let's go get something to eat.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” the confused blonde
agreed. She hadn't realized that she had said something funny. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil was about to make his shot when
Harry's hand flashed in front of his face, causing him to abort it in
mid stroke. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Trying to spoil my shot?” he asked
with a grin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sorry.” Harry opened his hand and
let the golf ball he'd caught fall to the ground. “Didn't think
you'd want to get hit.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good reflexes,” Phil commented
calmly. “James.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I thought you said my brother in law
wasn't playing today?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He wasn't supposed to be, sir,”
James replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mind if we cut the game short,
Harry?” Phil asked. “I think I've had enough close calls today.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come on,” Phil said, turning to
walk towards the clubhouse where there was less chance of being hit
by an errant shot. “I'll introduce you to Hermione's uncle. I think
you'll like him, he's a nice enough chap for a completely useless
bastard.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>After being forced to endure the horror
of being measured and fitted, Hermione and Luna retreated to the
safety of the garage to continue their work on Harry's motorbike
collection. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione.” The girl heard her
mother's voice. “You have a visitor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Who is . . . Professor Lupin,” she
said in delight. “What are you doing here?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Found two more boxes of those
parts,” Remus replied. “Not sure if you want them, but I put them
aside for you like you asked.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Remus,” Hermione said
sweetly. “I'll tell Harry that you're the one that's been finding
all this for him.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm not doing much,” Remus said
with a pleased blush. “Just cleaning the place up because I don't
have anything else to do.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Please bring any muggle things,
books, and notes to me before throwing them out,” Hermione
requested. “Everything you've found so far has been fascinating.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I won't throw anything out without
talking to you and Harry first,” Remus promised. “Not even the
dark items, might have to fight Bill for those though.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“What's he want with dark items?”
Hermione's lip curled in disgust. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Says removing the curses helps keep
his hand in,” Remus replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Tears were streaming down Harry's face
and his chest felt like it was going to burst. He hadn't laughed so
hard or so much in . . . maybe ever. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No more,” he wheezed. “No more
jokes, I don't think I can take it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Suit yourself,” Hermione's uncle,
the man that had introduced himself as Lord Useless the seventh
sniffed. “Youth these days have no endurance.” The man was just
over six feet with dark hair and a physique that gave lie to his
claims of idleness. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nah,” Phil disagreed. “It's like
getting exposed to an infectious disease the first time. Kid's got no
natural immunity.” He smirked. “I do, and as an expert on
infectious diseases, my professional opinion is that your jokes are
as bad as your game.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not my fault you weren't standing
anywhere near the hole,” Hermione's uncle barked. “We both know
that the object of the game is to get the ball anywhere but the hole
with extra points if you get it in the rough, the water, or the
sand.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You've got it backwards again.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So you say. I on the other hand
maintain that you're position is based on the fact that you're just
jealous of my perfect game.” With an upturned chin, he made an
obvious show of turning away from his brother in law. “So, Harry,
you're staying with my niece are you?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, sir,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Call me Jim,” he said easily. “Do
I need to make any threats about treating her right? I mean, it goes
without saying that I'll break your legs if you make her cry, doesn't
it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The staff already took care of
that,” Harry replied cheerfully. “I'll tell you the same thing I
told them. She's my best friend, if someone hurts her, I'll kill
them.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Both men were taken aback at the sense
of certainty in the boy's voice when he'd delivered the statement.
There had been no humor, no menace, no more emotion than if he'd been
commenting on the weather. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good to hear,” Jim replied weakly.
What in the hell had the boy endured to forge such steel at such a
young age? That thought was quickly followed by another, more
terrifying thought, had any of it spilled over onto his niece? He'd
have to make a note to request some time off to resolve things
personally if so. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry's got a Black Prince,” Phil
said suddenly, desperately hoping to change the subject even as his
mind whirled with similar thoughts to those of his brother in law. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My word, really!” Jim stared at
Harry for a couple seconds. “Any chance you'd be willing to sell it
to me?” he asked hopefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not at the moment,” Harry replied.
“I'll let you know if I change my mind.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wherever did you find it?” Jim
persisted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My godfather left it to me along
with his other motorbikes,” Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What else do you have?” Jim asked
eagerly. “Are you willing to part with any of it?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They're still going through it,”
Harry replied. “And not at this time.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Damn,” Jim cursed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He's got Hermione going through it
and putting it all back together,” Phil laughed. “Turned my
perfect little princess into a greasy petrolhead .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My niece working with her hands?”
Jim gasped. “Doing something productive? The family will never live
this latest shame down.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You'll just have to be extra useless
to balance things out,” Phil suggested. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“There's a thought,” Jim said
happily. “Knew I could count on you, Phil. One of the reasons I
never minded the fact that my dear sister married down.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I thought it was because I had top
shelf booze at our wedding and made sure that she invited all her
attractive unattached friends,” Phil shot back. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That too,” Jim agreed. &quot;Well,
mostly that.&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>

<P>Remus was on his way out of the
spacious Granger home when a hand the size of a shovel blade came to
rest on his shoulder. “Got a minute?” The man attached to the
massive paw asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you need?” Remus asked,
coming face to face with a man that had been introduced to him as one
of the drivers. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why don't you step into my office?”
the man suggested with a grin. “I'm gonna make you an offer you
can't refuse.”

<P>The chance to get a look at Harry's
bike collection proved to be irresistible to Hermione's uncle,
especially when it was coupled with a chance to spend some time with
the girl. At least that was his stated reason as to why he'd chosen
to accompany them back to the stately Granger estate. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione should be in the garage,”
Phil said to his brother in law as the car pulled to a stop. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And you expect me to walk from
here?” Jim whined, a look of comical dismay on his face. “It must
be at least fifty meters, that's inhuman.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's life,” Phil said nastily.
“Shouldn't have mooched a ride.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bastard,” Jim growled. He leapt
out of the car and stalked away. “Just for that, I'm writing you
out of my will again,” he said over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come on, Harry. He'll be back with
Hermione in a bit.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Remus was in a daze, he had a job. A
job that paid triple what he'd gotten as a Professor at Hogwarts
doing something he'd have happily done for free. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How in the world did I get back to
Grimmauld Place without splinching myself?” he wondered to himself.
No matter, he had work to do. “First thing's first,” he mumbled
to himself. “Have to get things ready to speak with Bill, wards
before everything else.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Jim walked through the door and, by
habit, stepped to the side. After a short pause to allow his eyes to
adjust, he began walking towards the sounds of someone working. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where's the prettiest girl in the
world?” he bellowed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uncle Jim,” Hermione squealed,
throwing herself into the big man's arms, ruining sevile row suit
with the grease smeared on her overalls. “I thought you were out of
the country again.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Accidentally blew up the place I was
staying in and had to come back in a hurry,” Jim explained with a
much put upon sigh. “You wouldn't think cooking breakfast for
yourself was so difficult, but it is. Let my example be a lesson to
you that you should leave that sort of thing to the staff.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione giggled, her uncle was always
joking about going to exotic place, meeting interesting people,  and
accidentally blowing them up. “Did you bring me back anything?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Have you been a good girl?” he
shot back. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Been absolutely rotten,” Hermione
said proudly. “It's all thanks to Harry too. He's a terrible
influence. Just last year we broke into a government building and
busted the place up.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What have you done lately?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Studying up on steam technology. The
beginning half of the year is always quiet. I don't expect things to
heat up for another few months.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good.” Jim filed that piece of
information away into his to look into later file. He reached into
his pocket and withdrew an engraved silver cigarette case. “Here
you go, my darling, use it in good health.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” Hermione asked
curiously, turning the item over in her hand. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Open it,” he prompted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The inside of the cigarette case was
filled with an assortment of saws, hooks, and other miniaturized
tools. “What's the map of?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The area around that school of yours
on one side and the area around a small island off the coast on the
other,” he said easily. “Replaced the one it came with since
you'll never go there if you've got any sense. Absolutely dull
place.” It also wouldn't be a good idea for anyone related to him
to go near for quite some time, even with all the trouble he went to
keeping his personal and professional lives separate. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why were you there, then?”
Hermione chirped. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Cause I don't have any sense,” he
answered with a grin. “Cheeky brat.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione's cheeks dimpled. “Uncle
Jim, I want you to meet my friend, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hello,” the little blonde said
shyly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're the one that's helping our
Hermione put together all the motorbikes?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I am, sir,” Luna agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Call me Jim. It's a pleasure to meet
you, Luna.” Jim gave the girl a wide grin. “Mind showing them to
me?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The blushing girl just shook her head
in reply. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come on, Uncle Jim.” Hermione
grabbed the man's hand and pulled him towards the garage. “We'll
give you the grand tour, right, Luna?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right,” Luna agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He allowed himself to be dragged into
the garage and to the skeleton of a partially assembled motorbikes.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“This is the latest one we've been
reassembling,” Hermione said proudly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><A NAME="T._E._Lawrence"></A>“A 1932
Brough Superior SS100 by god,” he whispered in awe. “That's the
bike T. E. Lawrence managed to kill himself on.” His head turned
violently from side to side, glancing at and identifying several of
the shadowy shapes. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's good?” Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>“It's bloody marvelous,” Jim
mumbled. “This whole collection is. It's mostly Triumphs and
Nortons, but by god the things he's got mixed in for flavor. Two
bloody Vincents, what kind of world just drops two bloody Vincents
into his lap. Do you know how hard I had to look to find the one I've
got?” he demanded. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry's always had the strangest
luck,” Luna spoke up. “Copious amounts of good and bad.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bloody hell,” the man mumbled to
himself. “I think you'd better take me back into the house before
my poor heart gives out.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you like the key to wine
cellar so you can get something to help recover your wits?”
Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The day I need a key to get into a
wine cellar is the day I'm too drunk to open a bottle,” he said
with an uplifted chin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Bill nodded his head a few times as
Remus explained the problem. It was a sticky one, but not beyond his
skill level. Gringotts had spent years and mountains of gold turning
him into one of the best at what he did. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Can you do it?” Remus finished
intently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't normally do this sort of
thing,” Bill admitted. “Not to say I can't, just that it'll take
me a bit longer to put them up then a professional Warder would. On
the other hand, I've run across a few things in my travels that most
British Warders have never so much as dreamed of.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“This place will be safe then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“For you and yours,” Bill agreed.
“It'll be a Death Eater's worst nightmare. Especially with the
little addition I made that targets dark marks, pity Dumbledore won't
allow me to add it to the protections at Headquarters and Hogwarts.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pity he thinks Snape is more
important than the students,” Remus spat. “Sorry about that,”
he added immediately. “It was uncalled for. It's just after hearing
about Harry's . . . ah . . . mishaps, I'm just a bit on edge.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It wasn't uncalled for,” Bill
sighed, wishing things were diffrent. “There's a reason I've been
enchanting my sibling's school robes.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They'll shrug off anything short of
an unforgivable,” Bill agreed proudly. “There are Aurors that go
into battle with less protections.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Can you . . .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll do the same for Harry and the
girls as soon as I finish with the house,” Bill promised. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry was in the sitting room with
Hermione's Parents when Jim arrived with the girls in tow. The man
then proceeded to spend the next several minutes describing the
collection of Motorbikes 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“God, not another one,” Anne
lamented. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Another what?” Luna chirped. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm afraid that collecting things is
a bit of a tradition in our families,” Phil laughed. “I like
cars, my father was fond of companies, and my grandfather liked
airplanes. Most of which are currently on loan to various museums at
the moment.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“On our side, Hermione had a
great-great-grandfather that collected titles, weapons, and medals,”
Jim picked up the conversation. “Bloody idiot probably clanked when
he moved. My father liked artwork, thought it made him . . . well, it
doesn't matter.” Not since the old man's stroke anyway. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you collect?” Harry asked.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Motorbikes,” Jim replied. “I'm
with you on that one, Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Also girlfriends and trouble,”
Anne interjected. “The stories I could tell.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Got a great collection of scars,”
Jim agreed. “Motorbike accidents, stupidity, and angry
ex-girlfriends all make for an interesting patchwork.” Not to
mention on the job injuries, most of which didn't fit the afore
mentioned categories. &quot;Got a line of dots across my bum from a
pitchfork.&quot; And a woman who was very unhappy to find him with
her twin sister, something he still maintained was not his fault
since how was he to have known?  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna,” Anne sighed dramatically.
“It looks as if the two of us are the only sane people here. My
husband with his cars, my brother and Harry with their motorbikes, my
daughter with her books. It's up to us to keep them from going madder
then they already are.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't listen to her, Luna,” Phil
advised. “She's as crazy as the rest of us.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Really?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My wife has an impressive collection
of jewelry,” Phil confided. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Which is still smaller then yours,”
Anne sighed. “Not to mention the fact that I inherited most of it
and that you're the one that gave me the rest of it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“See how she tries to justify her
neuroses?” Phil whispered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Best just to humor her,” Jim
advised. “She could snap at any moment.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron held his breath as the woman looked
over the sample. It was a testament to his state of mind that only a
small fraction of his attention was captured by the way her hands
were sensuously and suggestively caressing the wood he'd given her. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bit large,” she said after an
eternity of silence. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your hands are a bit small,” Ron
reposted. A hand reached up to mop the sweat off his brow. “Don't
match the tracing I was given at all.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She was sick,” the woman
explained. “It matters that much?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Does it . . .” Ron was so taken
aback by the woman's question that he forgot his earlier nervousness.
“Give me your hand.” Without waiting for an answer, he seized her
by the wrist and dragged the woman to the workbench he'd set up in
his father's shed. “Hold still,” Ron commanded. A couple seconds
later, he had a rough tracing of the woman's hand. “See?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What am I looking at?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The one on the left is the tracing I
was given.” He dropped it over the one he'd just made. “See how
it covers your hand?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” she agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If you want it to fit then don't
send me someone else's measurements. Wouldn't send a friend to get
fitted for your robes would you?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Suppose not,” she agreed with a
grin. “How soon to get a sample in my size?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Couple minutes for something rough,”
Ron muttered. He got no respect, absolutely no respect at all. “Sit
down.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What kind of wood are you using?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pine,” Ron replied as he tried to
find the right blank. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The shaft on my broomstick is made
out of maple,” she pointed out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then if you want a sample in maple,
you can bloody well pay for it. You want a free one, you're getting
pine.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright.” She settled down with a
smile. “I hear you play?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good enough to get on a house team
but not good enough to go pro,” Ron agreed surprising himself that
there wasn't even a hint of bitterness in his voice. “You want to
scout, talk to Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He has the wrong set of equipment to
play for my team,” she giggled. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well then your team better hope to
Merlin he doesn't decide to turn pro,” Ron laughed back. “If he
does, you'll have to get used to the idea of playing to be named
number two in the league. Harry Potter doesn't know how to lose.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you know?” she growled, a
bit annoyed by the boy's superior tone. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Enough to listen to Madame Hooch
when she decides to share her opinion.” Ron looked up from his
work. “Give me your hand.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Really?” she allowed him to seize
her by the wrist again. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She says that he's the finest
natural flyer she's ever seen and that he's gotten better every year
he's played,” Ron agreed. “Let me see the other.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Raw talent won't take you to the
top.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It will when you add a bunch of
private lessons with Madame Hooch,” Ron retorted. “Your hands are
different. Injury?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Bludger shattered the left and it
never healed right,” she agreed. “Is that important?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Which hand to you prefer to grip
with?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The left.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron pursed his lips. “Can't hold a
bat with it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, I grip with my legs and use the
left hand for balance.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We'll have to do something special
for you then,” Ron said slowly. “I'm gonna need you to cast a
couple charms for me.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Cause I don't feel like taking the
time to do it the muggle way,” Ron explained. “Try this.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Feels good,” she said in delight.
“Fits my hand like a glove.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Won't do you a whole lot of good
with that hand of yours, which is why we're going to try some other
things.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't worry about it,” she
laughed. “I've seen enough to recommend you to the others.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Really?” Ron's face lit up.
“That's great. I'd still like to try out my ideas with you though.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What are you doing tomorrow, kid?”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nothing important,” Ron replied.
“Come in your gear.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So we can get the best fit
possible.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh, I figured it was because you had
some twisted fantasy you wanted me to help you with,” she teased. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I do. Several actually,” Ron
admitted with a deep blush. “Best to get the business out of the
way first though.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>She stared at the boy in shock for a
split second before bursting into laughter. “You're alright.”
Looked like getting a new broom would be funner than she thought it
would be. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>After a moment to assure himself that
everyone had finished with their meals, Phil nodded to his guests as
everyone rose from the table.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Care to join me in the study for a
digestif, Harry, Jim?” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Alright, sir . . . eh . . .
Phil,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>“You know I never turn down free
booze,” Jim announced. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What about that martini you sent
back at my ninth birthday party?” Hermione asked innocently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They shook it, something anyone with
even an ounce of sense knows not to do. It doesn't count when they've
ruined a drink.” He raised his chin. “Only two reasons I would
ever lower myself to ordering something like that: The first is if I
was doing my best to convince the world that I was an ill bred
uncultured lout aping my betters, the second is if for some reason I
wanted my drink to be a bit watered down for some ungodly reason.
Stir clear drinks, shake the cloudy ones.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione giggled at the
uncharacteristic look of seriousness on her normally completely
unserious uncle's face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you girls care to join me in
the conservatory?” Anne asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione glanced over at Luna to read
her friend's face. “Okay, mum.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne smiled. “Wonderful, come along
girls.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Jim followed his brother in law to the
study and waited until the door was closed to put a shovel sized hand
on Harry's shoulder. “Let me tell you something, lad. The truth is,
I'm impressed, I honestly am. Fact is, well, fact is that I'd
normally applaud a man that was dating two women. Believe me when I
say that I understand more then anyone how difficult it can be, bad
enough when you're keeping them apart but when they know about each
other . . . well, that brings up a whole new set of problems doesn't
it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He allowed his grip to tighten a hair
and his voice dropped a couple of octaves. “Problem I have with
your situation is that one of the girls you're dating is my favorite
niece, the apple of my eye. Would you like to know what I'd do to
someone that hurt her, Harry?” He'd been joking at the course, he
was deadly serious now. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you like to know what I've
told everyone else?” Harry asked calmly, meeting the man's eyes. No
sign at all that he was the least intimidated.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Jim had to admit, if only privately,
that the boy had impressed him, there was no trace of fear in Harry's
voice. Another sign that he needed to take a serious look at what was
going on at his niece's school. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The only way that Hermione will get
hurt with me around is if they've got me first,” Harry said firmly.
“And even then they're going to have to climb over a pile of their
dead friends to get to her.” The boy's voice hardened. “Hermione's
good enough to get the ones I miss.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Fair enough,” Jim agreed,
relaxing. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And we're not dating,” Harry
added, breaking eye contact and blushing. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Jim rocked the room with a great
booming laugh. “Whatever you say, Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Molly looked around the table with a
satisfied smile on her face. She loved being surrounded with her
husband and children. She reached out and ladled another helping of
potatoes onto her youngest son's plate and added a slightly smaller
one to her sole daughter's. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm going to need your help with the
gardening tomorrow, Ronald,” Molly announced. “So-” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Can't do it tomorrow, mum,” Ron
interrupted, shocking the table. “Got a custom fitting to do.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Molly's eyes flashed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Who are you fitting, Ron?” Arthur
asked, cutting of his wife's tantrum. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“One of the Harpies' starting
beaters,” Ron replied. She's got a bad left hand so I think it'll
take most of the day. I'll try to get done early so I can help you
later, mum.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“One of the Harpies?” Molly
repeated dumbly. That put a whole new spin on things, he son wasn't
slacking off he was preparing for a future career. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah, mum. Madame Hooch set it up.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How well does it pay?” she needed
to make sure her baby would have enough to support himself after all.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't know how much it'll be,
mum.” He worked out a few figures. “I haven't established myself
yet so I have to keep my prices low.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ronald,” her tone had a bit of
warning in it. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Maybe three or four thousand
galleons.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Three thousand galleons?” she
squeaked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not that I'll see much of that since
I can't do any of the enchanting myself,” Ron hastened to add. “Not
to mention materials. Maybe a hundred for myself after everything is
done.” He scratched his chin. “Maybe more, maybe less. Hermione's
gonna help me figure it out later.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You be sure to thank her properly,”
Molly said automatically, still in shock from the numbers her son had
thrown out.”

<P>Neville woke up early and spent the
next few hours enduring the preparations for the day's party in
better cheer then he usually did. He wouldn't be alone, that thought
boosted him immensely. He might even be able to use Harry and the
others as an excuse to ignore the usual halfwits that his
grandmother's guests brought with them. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>He drifted through the rest of the day
in a daze until the house elves finally announced the arrival of his
friends. Neville flashed a quick smile at Harry and the girls as his
Gran made a more formal greeting.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Neville, why don't you show Mr.
Potter and his companions to the veranda while I continue my
discussion with Mrs. Granger,” Augusta ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Gran,” Neville agreed
quickly. “This way, guys.” He hadn't realized that the two women
had started a conversation. “I'm glad you came,” Neville added as
soon as he was sure they were out of earshot. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>She squeaked in shock as his hands
inadvertently brushed against another sensitive area and again when
he grabbed her by the thigh and rearranged things to his
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You know,” she began trying
desperately to keep her voice steady. “I usually expect dinner and
a drink before letting myself be manhandled like this.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?” Ron glanced up from his
work. “You say something?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Or at the very least an
introduction,” she continued. “Do you even know my name?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mandy Maxwell, starting left side
beater. Been in the league for three years, considered a shoe in for
the national team in the next world cup,” Ron recited. “Favorite
color is red, favorite food is human hearts, enjoys long walks on the
beach and beating men to death.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Favorite color is green, favorite
food is chips with a lot of malt vinegar, I do enjoy long walks on
the beach but prefer sitting under trees and listening to nature. Our
public relations folks came up with the answers you gave.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Guess you can't trust everything you
read after all.” Ron developed a wicked grin. “Gonna have to
remember to tell a friend of mine.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm sure.” Mandy smiled at the
boy, she wasn't that much older then he was, especially when one
considered the average magic user's lifespan.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Now all we need to do is . . . no,
guess that won't work. Maybe if we . . .” Ron frowned in
concentration. “Wait here.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron strode out of his workshop and
towards the garden in search of his mother.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Finished already?” Molly asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Need your help with something,”
Ron replied. “Can't cast any charms myself yet.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you need me to do?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Levitation charms,” Ron explained.
“I need you to levitate my blank so that I can make sure my
customer gets a good fit.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Molly agreed. She was
curious to see what her baby boy was doing in the shed anyway. “Just
give me a couple minutes to clean up.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry was awestruck at the view the
veranda on Neville's house afforded. Hermione and Luna, less so. Much
less so.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's that little house down there
for?” Hermione demanded. “Is it your guest house?” the girl
just couldn't understand why they'd spoil the view with such an
eyesore. The ugly thing was just the sort of shack new money would
slap together in some pathetic attempt to show how newly important
they thought they were. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's where Malfoy lives,”
Neville said sourly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That?” Harry asked incredulously.
“That? But . . . but it's so . . . so tiny. Hermione's garden shed
is bigger than that thing is.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?” Neville gave his friend an
odd look, trying to determine if the other boy was joking or telling
the truth.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't listen to him, Neville,”
Hermione said quickly. “My garden shed isn't even half the size of
Malfoy's house.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes it is,” Harry argued. Neither
teen noticed the sizable crowd of eavesdroppers they'd gathered.
“It's not as tall, but it covers a lot more space.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Which building are you talking
about, Harry?” Hermione bit her lower lip. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The one behind your father's
garage,” Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Those are the old stables, not the
garden shed,” Hermione explained. “Sorry about the confusion,
Neville,&quot; she said contritely.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No problem,” Neville said with a
wide toothy grin. He couldn't wait until the unintentional slight
reached the Malfoy family. “Just how big . . .” he caught
himself. “Never mind.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why are the Malfoys so close to
you?” Harry asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The Normans invaded and set up a
siege camp, the castle didn't fall and they never left.” Pity the
sewer no longer drained into their front yard. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hadn't realized Malfoy's family
was that old,” Hermione said, a bit impressed that the boy's boasts
had any substance at all. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It isn't,” Neville said quickly, a
bit embarrassed to have to be the one to explain things. “The
current Malfoy family bought the property about a hundred years ago.
They claimed to be from the branch of the original Malfoy family that
had never left France, but . . .” Neville shrugged. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You don't think so?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've read some of my ancestors
journals dealing with the time,” Neville agreed. “They mention
the fact that Altus Malfoy bore a strong resemblance to a Jacques
Roux, Beauxbatons class of 1880, muggleborn.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That doesn't make any sense,”
Hermione said in confusion. “Malfoy's always talking about how pure
he is. I . . .” she shook her head. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The young families are usually the
ones that feel they have something to prove,” Neville said gently,
hoping he wasn't going to offend one of the guests that were
eavesdropping on the conversation he was having with Hermione. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How long has your family been here,
Neville?” Luna asked cautiously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My blood's been on this spot since
before the Romans got here,” Neville announced proudly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So there's been a Longbottom on this
spot for more then two thousand years,” Hermione said softly. More
than a bit impressed by that bit of trivia. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No,” Neville said quickly, a bit
distressed by the confusion his poor explanations were causing. “The
Longbottom family has been here about three hundred years. Um, John
Longbottom married Angela Belasis and the family had no sons and
that's why I'm a Longbottom. I can't remember what family the
Belasises married into.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Molly was more then a bit mystified by
everything her youngest son had asked her to do. First he'd had her
levitate the stick he'd been carving, then he'd had the woman climb
on to it, and now he was asking her to turn the stick upside down. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Need to make sure she can hold on,
mum,” Ron explained quickly. “Give her a couple bounces if she
does.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Please,” the woman added. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright.” Molly flicked her wand a
couple times causing the woman to rotate. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Faster,” Ron demanded. “And
rougher.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's . . .” Mandy bit her tongue
before she could add the words 'my line,' probably not the best thing
to say in front of his mother. “Perfectly fine,” she covered.
“Better to fall off two feet above the ground than two hundred.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If you're sure,” Molly agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How is it?” Ron demanded</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Much better then the broom I've got
now,” Mandy enthused. “How soon can you modify the one I've got?”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Might be better to build a new one
from scratch with all the work we gotta do cause of your hand,” Ron
demurred. “Freeze it, mum.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Molly was scandalized by the way her
son walked over to the woman and began cavalierly doing things with
his hands in places no gentleman had any business.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ronald-”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Could you hand me that pencil by
you, mum?” Ron interrupted. “I need to get these marks in so I
can make some adjustments.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?” Molly asked dumbly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pretend he's a tailor,” Mandy
advised. “You know how it is when you're getting a new robe fitted.
It's the same thing here.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I suppose,” Molly sighed. The
things she put up with for the sake of her children. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Augusta watched in amusement as Anne, a
woman who showed a surprising amount of decorum for a mere muggle,
broke off the conversation to take a quick look around the room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Problem?” Augusta asked mildly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I seem to have misplaced my
husband,” Anne admitted. “I do apologize, he's never been too
fond of social gatherings. Probably hiding in some out of the way
corner, I'll have security run him down later.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“His upbringing not prepare him for
gatherings of this sort?” Augusta asked cautiously, not wanting to
offend. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It did, it's his nature that's
getting in the way here.” She smiled fondly. “He's always been a
bit shy around crowds.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” Augusta nodded. “I would
have never guessed it judging by how he dresses.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“New money, you understand.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My husband's family were mostly
merchants until about two, three hundred years ago,” Anne said with
a dismissive wave. “I think my mother traced them back to the
sixteen hundreds before she got bored or something like that.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Really?” Augusta said in surprise.
“Why did she do that?” she hadn't thought that sort of thing was
important to muggles. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My mother, step mother I should say,
was a horrible snob and more then a bit disgusted that I was marrying
'below my station' instead of catching Lord inbred the fifth like she
wanted,” Anne giggled. “Certainly changed her tune when she
realized that he could buy and sell our family with pocket change.
Then again she always was a bit of a gold digger. I always maintained
that daddy never should have married her, not that I was ever asked
for my opinion on the matter.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I understand,” Augusta laughed.
“My elder brother did something similar.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm just glad that my husband is
more sensible then that,” Anne sniffed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“As was mine. If there was one time
he showed good judgement, it was when he chose his wife,” Augusta
pronounced severely. The two women maintained their serious
expressions for a few seconds before dissolving into laughter. “What
about your family?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmm?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You said your husband comes from a
line of merchants and that your mother was a snob,” Augusta
prompted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Molly watched in fascination as Ron
carved the broomstick blank. She'd never seen this side of her son,
never expected him to put much effort into anything until he was hit
by reality and forced to become a responsible member of society. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Interesting, isn't it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The other woman's voice brought Molly
back to reality. “I'm sorry?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Interesting, isn't it?” Mandy
repeated. “The way he gets so focused.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've never seen him like this,”
Molly confessed. “Would you like something to drink? Or I suppose I
could get you some snacks.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm fine,” Mandy said quickly. “My
trainer would kill me if I broke her carefully constructed diet.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're on a diet?” Molly's face
showed disbelief. “As thin as you are?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's more about strength and
endurance then it is about loosing weight,” she explained. “Uh,
would you mind if I spent more time here?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Take as much time as you'd like,
dear,” Molly said brightly. “We want your new broomstick to fit
perfectly don't we?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's not . . .” Mandy licked her
lips. “Do you mind if I continue visiting even after my broomstick
is completed?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Molly smile widened. “Not at all,
dear. Not at all.” 
</P>

</P>
<P>Phil had a smile on his face when he
rejoined his wife and daughter. He'd have never thought a magical
party could be so potentially profitable, just went to show that
people were the same and that magic mattered not a wit. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Have a good conversation with your
friends, darling?” he drawled. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, daddy,” Hermione agreed. “Did
you enjoy yourself, mum?” Neville had been so shocked when his Gran
spent the majority of the party conversing with only one guest. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I did, darling. Augusta and I have
been talking and you'll never guess what we've determined,” Anne
said to her daughter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's that, mum?” Hermione asked.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You and Neville are cousins,”
Augusta said with a faint smile. “Well, distant ones anyway.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think we figured it was five
hundred years since any of us have had a common ancestor,” Anne
added. “I'd have to go through the books to be sure.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Still, it's very interesting.”
Augusta gave the Grangers a measured look. “Very interesting
indeed.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You throw a lovely party, Augusta.
You simply must allow us to host you some time,” Anne demanded as
she shrugged into her coat. “After that, I would love to get a
chance to introduce you to society.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I would love the chance,” Augusta
agreed. “Thank you for the invitation, Anne. Shall we pencil
something in after classes resume?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We'll work out the details later,”
Anne agreed. “Have a good evening, Augusta.”

<P>Remus watched as Bill finished layering
the initial wards over the Granger estates. What was supposed to have
been a thirty minute job had turned into a grueling six hour
endurance test. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's the first bit,” Bill
gasped. “Be able to add the next bit the day after tomorrow.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You said it would take thirty
minutes.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You didn't say how bloody big this
place is,” Bill retorted. “If I'd have known.” Bill shook his
head. “Warding a castle is a bloody big job you know.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They've got another house in London
they'll want done later,” Remus announced. “Not to mention the
school robes and the Granger wardrobe.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm gonna have to take a leave of
absence to do all this,” Bill moaned. “Do you know how much the
goblins hate it when you take time off?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“All this warding going to cause you
trouble with them?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They hired me to break wards, not
make them. The goblins could care less how many wards I put up. Be
another story if I was taking them down,” he added. “You owe me a
beer for this.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll get you two,” Remus promised.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I can do this about two months
before I have to choose between going back to work and eating my
shoes, should be able to get the house secure in that time. Not sure
about the grounds.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uh. You do know that you're being
paid for this, don't you?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Really?” Bill grinned, perking up.
“Six months before I have to go back to work or tender my
resignation.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How much faster would things go if
you had some help?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Depends on the help,” Bill
replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Give me a list of names.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Both men turned to watch the Granger's
car pull up the drive. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's another thing I should slap
wards on,” Bill said thoughtfully. “Don't want them to be
defenseless when they're on the move.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll have a talk with their security
people,” Remus agreed.

<P>Tonks made a quick scan of the room
before stepping aside to let her charge through. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“All clear, boss.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Are you going to tell me about the
offer you got from the Granger security people?” Amelia asked as
she took a seat. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You know about that?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Amelia smiled. “I know everything,
that's why I'm the director.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, boss. Was planning to tell you,
just not sure how to bring it up.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You going to take it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't know, boss. I like working
for you, but . . .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But then there's all the other
bastards in the department, eh?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah, that.” Tonks sighed. “And
the fact that they're offering to double my pay. What do you think I
should do, boss?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think you should take the job and
let me put you down as working a confidential undercover assignment,”
Amelia replied. “Two paychecks for one job.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You want me to spy on the Grangers?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I want a backchannel to a family
that will soon have as many arms-men as the Ministry,” Amelia
corrected. “It won't bother me at all if the Grangers know you're
still working for me.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Makes sense,” Tonks admitted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Makes even more sense when you know
that the Ministry rejected my latest request to expand,” Amelia
growled. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Even after they've admitted that
you-know-who is back?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Even then. I can activate a few on
the reserve rolls and I can ramp up training. But I am expressly
forbidden from inducting new members of the Auror corps than is
traditionally authorized.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Gonna expand the training class and
feed the extras to the Grangers?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Something like that,” Amelia
agreed with a smirk.

<P>Neville came down to breakfast to find
his Gran already sitting at the table surrounded by several stacks of
parchments. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You'll never guess what I've found,
Neville,” the old woman announced. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, Gran?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your friend Hermione is descended,
on her mother's side, from the Primus Pilus of the Legio XX Valeria
who retired with a local wife.” Which her contacts assured her was
from a very good family, they were still trying to run down all the
details. “A man of that same line stood beside Arthur in the
defense of Britannia against the invading Saxons.” Augusta smiled
tightly. “The family's fortunes have ebbed and flowed since then,
but the male line has never been broken.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Neville's eyes were wide in shock. “I
didn't know muggles could trace that sort of thing?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I had to do a record search with
Hogwarts, the Goblins, and the Ministry,” Augusta explained. “A
lucky thing her family has produced the odd magic user over the
centuries or I may not have been able to discover what I did.” The
old woman gave her grandson a measured look. “She would make an
excellent bride for you, Neville. Pity the Potter found her first.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Gran,” Neville sputtered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Still, you did well to befriend
her.” The old woman continued, seemingly ignoring her grandson's
discomfort. “Very well indeed. Since the girl herself is
unavailable, perhaps I could ask Anne to match you with one of
Hermione's cousins?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Murgle.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Augusta's smile broke as Neville fled
the room with a look of horror on his face. “Still not a bad idea,
even if I did mean it in jest,” she mused. It would be good to
inject a bit of new blood into the Longbottom line, especially if
that blood was of the right sort.

<P>Luna's lower lip was quivering as she
prepared to leave the Granger estates. It had been so nice to spend
every day with friends. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Goodbye, Hermione.” She threw
herself into the other girl's arms. “I will see you after Boxing
Day.” 
</P>
<P><BR>

<P>“See you in a couple days, Luna,”
Hermione replied.

<P>“Goodbye, Harry.” Luna cautiously
hugged the boy. “I will see you soon.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Have fun spending Christmas with
your father,” Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Are you sure you don't want us to
ride with you?” Hermione asked for the tenth time. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, it's not a very long trip to the
place father is picking me up.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>In later life, Harry would always
treasure the memory of his first real Christmas. The first time he
could remember feeling like he was part of a family during the
holiday season. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>'Perhaps I should have accepted the
Weasleys invitations to spend Christmas with them,' he thought
regretfully. 'Then I'd have been able to experience this earlier.'</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione had woken him as the sun was
painting the sky red and demanded that he join her under the tree,
insisting that she couldn't wait for him to open his gift a minute
longer. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The world seemed to spin and the next
thing Harry knew, he was seated under the watchful eyes of Hermione's
parents as the girl thrust a small green wrapped box into his hands. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I hope you like it, Harry,”
Hermione offered with a shy blush. “Professor McGonagall helped me
pick it out.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry carefully opened the box and his
breath caught when he saw what was inside. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You never replaced the one you broke
in the tournament and I thought it was time you had a new one so you
didn't have an excuse to be late for class,” Hermione prattled. “Do
you like it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” Harry agreed. “I like it
very much. Thank you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione's smile lit up the room. “I
was hoping you would.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mind if I take a look, Harry?”
Phil asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Mindful of the expectant look on his
daughter's face, the head of the Granger family resolved to find
something favorable to say no matter what his true opinions may be.
He was pleasantly surprised by what he found. “Hamilton?” a smile
bloomed on the man's face. “These were some of the best watches to
be had when they made them. Shame digitals took over the market.”
Even greater shame the American watch industry had disappeared, be
good for the Swiss to have a bit of real competition in the
mechanical market. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's also charmed to be almost
indestructible,” Hermione supplied. “It has to be to survive
around Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry opened his mouth but the protest
died in his throat before he said a word. Depressing as it was, the
girl had made a fair assessment. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Here.” Harry thrust a wrapped tube
shaped package into Hermione's hands. “I hope you like it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Harry.” Hermione tore
off the paper to reveal a tube of fitted lacquered bamboo slats
capped at each end with darkly glazed porcelain figures. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a portable writing desk from
China,” Harry explained. “One cap is an inkwell, and the other
holds brushes and quills.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How does it work?” Hermione asked
curiously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Pull out the caps,” Harry
instructed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The girl complied, causing her gift to
unroll to create a floating platform. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It'll store five hundred sheets of
parchment and hold up to fifty pounds, you can also move it and the
caps to wherever you want,” Harry explained. “Oh, and the inkwell
is charmed so that it will never spill.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How many quills and brushes does it
hold?” Hermione was entranced. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Five brushes, two dozen quills, or
seven fountain pens. I had them put a mix in to start with,” Harry
replied. “Do you like it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I love it,” Hermione exclaimed,
wrapping her friend in a hug. “Thank you so much, Harry.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hedwig will be happy to hear that,”
Harry said with a grin. “It took her almost two days to get it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll be sure to thank her then too,”
Hermione giggled. “Um, how do I close it up again?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just roll it up.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>They spent the next couple hours
opening gifts and marveling over each other's new possessions. Most
notable of which was a silver lighter Harry received  from Hermione's
Uncle Jim along with a note explaining each of the objects eighty two
functions and a fancy new fountain pen Hermione got from her former
governess which, the woman had explained, was heavily enchanted with
tracking and protection charms. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione sat in surrounded by the
shattered remains of the packaging and wrapping looking around to see
if she had missed anything. The girl was beginning to develop a
faintly puzzled look, entirely due to the fact that there wasn't
anything left of the pile of gifts and she hadn't yet opened anything
from her parents.<BR><BR>&quot;Before we forget,&quot; Phil said,
&quot;There's one thing left, but it's a bit big for the drawing
room.&quot;<BR><BR>Harry blinked twice, glancing around the large and
decidedly opulent room.<BR><BR>What the...?<BR><BR>&quot;It's just
out in the stable yard.&quot; Anne said. &quot;Come along
now.&quot;<BR><BR>Increasingly puzzled, the children followed
Hermione's parents out to the manor's courtyard.<BR><BR>Here they
were presented by a quite peculiar sight; a low-loader trailer for an
articulated lorry, with a tarpaulin-wrapped object the size of a very
large car (or small bus) sat upon it and tied up with a red
ribbon.<BR><BR>It was Hermione's turn to blink bemusedly.<BR><BR>She
cautiously approached the tarps, noted the tag marked, 'To Hermione,
Love Mum and Dad', and pulled the edge of one up to peer
beneath.<BR><BR>She then promptly froze, her eyes going about the
size of Frisbees, and blinked several times.<BR><BR>Phil smirked, and
yanked a specific rope; there was a twang, and a couple of sharp tugs
on the tarps had them slithering off to reveal a rust-dotted, sooty,
oil-streaked metal beast.<BR><BR>It was about the smallest full-sized
steam engine Harry had ever seen. About twenty feet long with four
chunky wheels and a hefty squared-off water tank (from the top of
which a stubby funnel protruded) shrouding it's boiler, it had once
been painted royal blue with bright red details here and there,
though that was fairly hard to see through the dirt and streaks of
rust, and the paint was kinda faded.<BR><BR>&quot;Merry Christmas,
Hermione.&quot; Phil said.<BR><BR>Hermione, for her part, was still
rooted to the spot.<BR><BR>&quot;It's ex Coal Board.&quot; Anne
provided. &quot;We had a dickens of a time tracking it
down.&quot;<BR><BR>Hermione was still rooted to the spot.<BR><BR>Her
parents were just sharing a concerned was-this-a-mistake look when
she produced the most extraordinarily girlish squeak Harry had ever
heard from her and went madly scrambling up into the aging engine's
cab, wherein she spent nearly a minute poking around before, with
another squeak, zooming out and latching onto both her parents at
once while gabbling on her gratitude at about a thousand miles a
minute.<BR><BR>Harry went over and had a closer look at the engine,
in particular the oval brass plate on the side of it's cab.<BR><BR>It
had, 'Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co' arching over the top,
'Kilmarnock' looping round the bottom, and 'Limited' 'Caledonia
Works' No 1836 1924' in descending order in the middle; it didn't
make much sense but he figured Hermione would be all too happy to
explain it.<BR><BR>Wait, had Hermione's parents just given her a REAL
steam engine?<BR><BR>&quot;Does it work?&quot; he asked, frankly not
quite believing what he was seeing.<BR><BR>&quot;Of course!&quot;
Phil said, sounding like that was a silly question. &quot;The chap
who showed me it said it's sorely needing maintenance, but he had it
running while I was there.&quot;<BR><BR>Hermione let out another
delighted squeak. At this point, speech seemed to be completely
beyond her.<BR><BR>Harry looked back at the engine, and said the only
thing he could think of to say;<BR><BR>&quot;Wow...&quot;<BR><BR>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>It took almost four hours to pry
Hermione away from her new engine and to the breakfast table and even
then, the soot covered girl kept casting longing gazes out the window
at her new treasure, her precious. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hermione, stop being rude,” Anne
scolded. “I know I had the maids raise you better than that,” she
finished with a smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Sorry, mum,&quot; Hermione
mumbled, &quot;It's just, her right-hand valve gear is sticking, half
of her boiler tubes are punctured, and her left-hand big end bearing
is shot - and I've only got two weeks before I go back to
Hogwarts...&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't worry about that,” Phil
laughed. “I've got it all taken care of. Picked up a piece of land,
an old coal mine with plenty of track, near that school of yours.
Should have a spur line to Hogwarts finished shortly after you get
back to school?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, daddy,” Hermione
chirped. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank the tax break I was able to
arrange and all the good publicity I'm going to get with the locals
for bringing in a few jobs,” Phil replied. “Be good and I might
even be able to arrange a couple more engines to keep the one outside
from getting too lonely.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Being good means we clean the soot
off before coming to the table,” Anne interjected. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione stood up with her chin in the
air. “If you will excuse me, mother, I am in dire need of a bath.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We'll wait for you to finish before
we start breakfast.” Phil checked his watch. “Make that lunch.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Molly was shocked to the core when she
noticed that her youngest son had not come in for lunch. It wasn't
like the boy to miss a meal. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where's Ronald?” She asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“In the shed,” Arthur replied. “Do
you want me to get him?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll do it,” Molly said. She
walked outside and was mystified by the odd contraption her boy was
fiddling with. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mum, good timing,” Ron cheered.
“Could you make this spin?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” Molly asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's a lathe,” Ron replied. “You
see, the wood spins here and I can use it to turn a new beaters bat.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Finished with the broom, then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's at Nimbus being enchanted,”
Ron agreed. “The Harpies have some sort of deal with the company.”
Which was fortunate in that it meant his profit margin was going to
be much higher than expected.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's nice,” Molly mumbled. “Come
inside, I'll enchant your lith after we eat.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Lathe, mum,” Ron groaned. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Whatever it is, we can deal with it
after lunch.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione's Uncle Jim arrived shortly
after they'd persuaded the girl to clean herself up and shortly
before they sat down to eat lunch. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Never pass up an opportunity for a
free meal,” the big man explained. “How'd you like that lighter,
Harry?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Quite a bit,” Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good, picked it up from an American
chap I sometimes work with and figured that you'd have more use for
it than I do.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is your work?” Harry blurted.
“If you don't mind my asking.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm a glorified cleaner,”
Hermione's uncle Jim explained. “When there's a mess my employers
send me in to take care of it. They also use me as a distraction
sometimes, I'm high profile enough that the opposition focusses on me
when I'm in the area and that lets my colleagues do their jobs
without too much bother. Why do you ask?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just curious where you got all those
gadgets you gave Hermione,” Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Friend of mine makes them for me,”
he laughed. “Different friend than the one that made your new
lighter.” Someone in his line of work that occasionally worked for
the American Government. One of the rare freelancers in the business.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh, I-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uncle Jim, look what Harry got me,”
Hermione yelled, rushing down the stairs. She demonstrated how to use
her new portable desk. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Interesting,” the man agreed.
“Anyway you could get more of these, Harry?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah,” Harry agreed dumbly. “You
know about magic?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I know about a lot of things,” Jim
said mysteriously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wait here a moment,” Harry asked.
He rushed up the stairs and came back a few minutes later with a box
that looked like it was painted with rainbow vomit. “Merry
Christmas.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Harry,” Uncle Jim said,
taking the box. He carefully opened the box and began to laugh.
“What's all this?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Magical gadgets,” Harry replied.
“Got a couple mates from school that make them. Just read the
directions first or you might accidentally turn yourself into
something.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're giving him something you got
from the twins?” Hermione hissed. “Harry, you know the wouldn't
be able to resist booby trapping it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's me, so they won't do anything,”
Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've got an agreement with them,
trust me,” Harry said, placing a hand on her shoulder. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Jim grinned at the way his niece
immediately calmed down and unconsciously leaned into her friend. To
be young again. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I trust you, Harry,” Hermione
assured him. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Since that's all settled, let's
eat,” Jim said loudly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron gulped down his meal and rushed
back to the shed. Only to return a few minutes later with a deep
blush. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uh, mum?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll be out in a minute, Ron,”
Molly agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thanks, mum,” Ron replied. “I'll
be waiting.” The boy rushed back out. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What does he need?” Arthur asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He needs me to enchant a . . . leek,
liik, laik, something to spin,” Molly replied. “He's making a new
beater's bat for his friend.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh?” Arthur smiled. “He hasn't
grown tired of making Quidditch stuff yet? Good, glad the boy's found
a trade that'll keep him out of the Ministry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Arthur, the Ministry is-” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No place for anyone,” Arthur said
firmly. “It's a steady paycheck and that's all.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I suppose,” Molly agreed. She
looked over at Fred and George. “That doesn't mean I don't still
expect you two to do your best and pass your NEWTs. Even if you do
decide to keep that joke shop of yours, I want you to have something
else to fall back on.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay, mum-”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“-whatever you say.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That means if your scores are high
enough I won't say anything about the 'research' you two do in your
room,” Molly added. She stood up. “I also expect you two to leave
your siblings alone, do that and we won't have any problems.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Deal, mum,” the twins agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Molly walked outside to join her
youngest son in the shed. “What do you need me to do?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just make this piece spin, mum,”
Ron replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Molly agreed. She
watched in fascination as the boy used a chisel shape a beater's bat
from the chunk of wood. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Slow it down a bit, mum,” Ron
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Molly agreed. “What
are you doing now?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sanding it smooth,” Ron replied.
“Then I'm going to take it off the lathe and sand it again and
again and again till I'm satisfied.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“After that?” Molly prompted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“After that, I'm going to free hand
the handle, sand it to the right shape if I need to, rub a few coats
of boiled linseed oil into onto the bat, wrap the handle with
sharkskin and I'll be finished.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why are you using sharkskin?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Grip, no one else does it but
there's no rule against it.” Ron clapped his hands to remove some
of the sawdust. “Madame Hooch says duelers like to use it on their
wands, figured I'd try it here.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Did you do that on the broom you
made?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nah, I checkered grips on the broom.
Can't do it on the bat cause of league rules,” Ron explained. “And
we're done with the first bit, thanks, mum.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Happy to help, Ron,” Molly said
with a smile. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione spent almost every waking
moment of the next day poring over her new toy and chattering
excitedly about what she and Luna were going to do with it. Her
mother was not amused. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I am sorry about all this, Harry,”
Anne sighed. “I wish I could say she got this madness from her
father's side but I'm afraid mine's also been known to get a bit
obsessive with things.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's alright,” Harry laughed.
“She's the same way at school. I'm just happy she's got something
to distract her from dragging me into it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Give it another day and she'll
remember you exist again,” Anne replied with a smirk. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Give it another day and Luna will be
here to distract her,” Harry retorted. “They'll feed each other's
madness in a never ending loop of insanity and I'll be safe.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>True to Harry's prediction, Luna
arrived early the next morning and was immediately drawn towards
Hermione's newest and favorite possession. The two girls spent the
entire morning happily chattering at each other and poking into every
one of the engine's many nooks and crannies. They were both covered
head to two in grease when Anne finally managed to drag them away
from the locomotive to take lunch. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Clean and get down here,” Anne
said shortly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But we'll just get dirty again,
mum,” Hermione tried, hoping to get back to the engine as soon as
possible. “It'd be more efficient to just get a couple sandwiches
to eat outside.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You are not just going to get dirty
again because you are not going to mess with your train until
tomorrow,” the woman said firmly. “And tomorrow, you will be
freshly washed and sitting at the table before lunch or you will not
be messing with the train for the remainder of the holiday. Do you
understand me, Hermione?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“But, mum, I-” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It was a simple question,” Anne
interrupted. “Do I have to ask it again?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, mum.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well?” She prompted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I understand, mum,” Hermione
agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good, now hurry up and get washed.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, mum,” Hermione sighed. “Come
on, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right behind you, Hermione,” Luna
agreed. “See you at lunch, Mrs. Granger.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Call me, Anne, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Luna agreed before
falling into step behind Hermione. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What are we gonna do now, Luna?”
Hermione whined. She wanted to get back to her engine, her . . .
precious. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Research,” Luna chirped. “You
said we'd have an opportunity to play with the engine after we get
back to Hogwarts. On the other hand, your library is not something
we'll have access to when we're back at Hogwarts.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're right,” Hermione sighed.
“It's just . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I know,” Luna agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne walked into the dining room, took
her place, closed her eyes, and rubbed her temples. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Chore to drag Hermione away from her
new toy?” Phil asked innocently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That girl,” Anne groaned. “This
is all your fault you know. She gets the obsessiveness from your side
and you were the one to feed it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Both sides, I think.” He turned to
Harry. “You've got my sympathies, Harry, having to deal with it all
year.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She's not usually this bad,” Harry
laughed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Still, I'm going to have to have a
long talk with that girl if this keeps up,” Anne promised. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The three of them made small talk until
they were joined by a freshly washed Hermione and Luna. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Let me see your fingernails,” Anne
ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“All clean,” Hermione said. “See.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sparkling,” Anne agreed. “How'd
you manage that so fast?” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Luna brought some soap that
works wonders,” Hermione replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good job, Luna,” Anne said with a
grin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you.” Luna blushed a deep
red. “Father uses it after he has to maintain the press and I
figured if it works for father, it should work for us too.” 
</P>
<P><BR>

<P>Molly watched as her son carefully
shaved sliver after sliver from the handle of the newly made beater's
bat. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why are you being so careful?” She
asked after he'd paused for a moment. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I want it to fit her hand
perfectly,” Ron replied. “The big companies don't bother with
this sort of custom work, but I think there's money in it so . . .”
he shrugged his shoulders. “Besides, I wanted to do something nice
for her.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And if that something nice gets you
a bit of free advertising, what's the harm in that?” Molly giggled.
“Good boy.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I try, mum.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You get it from your uncles,”
Molly said. “My brothers were always looking for an angle.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron cracked his neck. “Good to know.”
Pity he hadn't been able to meet them. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What are you going to do next?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Going to rough it up so the
sharkskin has something to stick to, then I'm going to wrap it,”
Ron replied. “I'll need your help with the sticking charms.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Molly agreed. “Are
there any other charms you need me to cast on it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“There's a few,” Ron admitted.
“Wasn't going to trouble you with them.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Was it because you didn't want
to bother me or because you have someone else that could do them
better?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The first, mum. League doesn't allow
anything complicated so each of the charms gets removed and re-cast
before each match.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Point them out to me so I have time
to practice them,” Molly ordered. “It's usually a good idea to
test things before letting them out into the world.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure thing, mum,” Ron agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna walked into Anne's study with a
pensive look on her face. She really hoped that the woman would be
willing to help, she so rarely got an opportunity to solicit advice
from an adult female. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it, Luna?” Anne asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Can I ask you a few things?” Luna
asked hopefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Anne agreed. “Have a
seat.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“It's just, I was reading through
some of Hermione's books and . . . it's all so confusing.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright,” Anne prompted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well, is it true that . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>

</P>
<P>Phil found Harry hiding in the stables
with the horses. It wasn't a surprise that the boy had made himself
scarce, not after his prediction about the girls feeding each other's
madness had turned out to be accurate. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Trying to avoid my daughter?” He
asked with a grin. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Trying to get to know the ponies so
there's a bit of trust built up before the next polo game,” Harry
replied. “The fact that this allows me to coincidentally avoid
getting caught up in Hermione's madness is a bonus.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Speaking of polo, you up for a game
in a day or two?” Phil asked hopefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Harry agreed. “Whenever.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wonderful, I'll leave you to it
then.” Phil walked out of the stables and back to the house. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne had a dazed smile as her
conversation with Luna wound down. The things the little blonde had
wanted to know and the details she'd been curious about were  a bit
more . . . earthy than she'd expected. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Let me have a word with your
father,” Anne offered. “With his permission, I'll answer every
question you have.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay,” Luna agreed. “Thank you,
Anne.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Happy to help, Luna,” Anne said
warmly. After she was sure the girl was gone, she threw open the door
that connected her study with her husband's. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I just had the most interesting
conversation with young Luna,” Anne announced as she walked into
Phil's office. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Oh?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She got into Hermione's romances,”
Anne said simply. 
</P>
<P><BR>“I thought those were all for the
maids and any that may have slipped into our daughter's stack of
reading material got there by accident and not certainly not by
intention and that we had best just put them out of our minds and
that she would be sure they were correctly filed in the future and
there was no need to trouble ourselves about them,” Phil said
dryly, repeating his daughter's stuttered excuses. “Because our
daughter would never dream of reading something so frightfully common
and so completely devoid of literary or educational merit.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's the story we're supposed to
believe anyway,” Anne agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So what did she want to ask you?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“She wanted to know if it was true
that powerful men kept a girl on the side,” Anne replied. “She
then asked if Harry was powerful enough.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?” he choked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Seems that she's more than a bit
terrified that she'll loose her friends and was wondering if becoming
his mistress might be a way to keep hold of them,” Anne said
softly. “Poor thing got really worked up about it when I talked to
her and I got the impression that Harry and Hermione were her only
friends in the world.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And I admitted that my grandfather
had a friend on the side, then I pointed out that my grandmother did
her very best to pretend that the other woman didn't exist. She said
that wasn't how it worked in the book and then the conversation got a
bit personal,” Anne giggled. “All I'll say is that she's a very
imaginative girl.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I trust that things are taken care
of,” Phil said hopefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've convinced her that her friends
aren't going anywhere and that any talk of marriage or . . . uh . . .
other arrangements should wait until they were all well out of
school,” Anne reported. “To be honest I'm fairly sure that she
had no idea what a friend on the side did, I'm almost certain she
didn't understand what the books had to say about the matter, just
that it would give her a chance to stay with the others.”<BR><BR>“I
see.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm going to have a talk with her
father,” Anne continued. “If that pans out the way I hope it
does, I'm going to have a long conversation with Luna about the ways
of the world.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Have fun with that,” Phil laughed.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Have fun with Harry,” Anne
retorted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm going to have a talk with the
girls,” Anne explained. “While I do that, you be sure to answer
any questions Harry might have.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll be sure to let him know that
I'm here,” Phil promised. “Though I think it'd be in the lad's
best interests if I pointed him to your elder brother.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Only if you want him to bed all the
girls in his school and half the teachers by the end of the year,”
Anne giggled. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm not the one that would have to
deal with the paternity suits.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You are the one that would have to
deal with Hermione's broken heart,” Anne retorted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll take care of things with Harry,
you go use the fire to talk with Luna's father,” Phil replied,
privately agreeing with his wife's statement. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll let you know how things go.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You do that,” he agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Anne walked downstairs, tossed a
handful of floo powder into the fire and prepared for what she feared
would be a difficult conversation. It wasn't. Luna's father, it
turned out, was almost pathetically grateful to have a woman
available to steer his daughter through the difficult curves
explaining that while he'd done his best, he really had no idea of
how to raise a daughter or a son for that matter. Poor man was lost
without his dear departed wife. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Look at the time,” Anne said
suddenly, hoping to end a conversation that had gotten much too
personal. “I'm afraid I really must go.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If you must,” Luna's father
agreed. “Again, I must thank you for what you're doing for my
little Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Happy to help, Luna's almost one of
the family at this point.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Goodbye,” he said. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Bye.” The flames flared once
before going back to normal. “I am never going to get used to
that,” she muttered to herself. Her head swiveled around till she
found one of the servants. “Could you please have the girls meet me
at the table.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Should I announce that dinner is
going to be early, ma'am?” The maid asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Give me five minutes alone with the
girls and then go ahead,” Anne agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, ma'am.” It didn't take long
for the maid to find the two girls, they were reading books in the
library. “Your mother wishes to speak with you and Luna in the
dining room, Ms. Hermione.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Sally.” Hermione
yawned. “Come on, Luna.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right behind you, Hermione,” Luna
agreed. The two girls walked down the stairs to the dining room and
took their seats at the table. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You wanted to speak with us, mum?”
Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes,” she agreed. “I need you to
save an hour or two tomorrow afternoon.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione glanced at Luna. “Okay,
mum.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>It was with no small amount of
trepidation that Hermione went to the meeting with her mother the
next afternoon. She cast an envious look at her friend, Luna was
bouncing along without a care in the world, it must be nice to be so
innocent.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Come in, girls,” Anne said, waving
them into her office. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's this about, mum?” Hermione
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Luna had some questions for me that
I wasn't able to answer the other day,” Anne replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You've spoken with Father?” Luna
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I have, and he's told me that he
doesn't mind me giving you this talk,” Anne agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Hermione's eyes widened in fear, she
couldn't mean. “What talk, mum?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think we should start with
biology,” Anne said thoughtfully. “I presume you've already
looked through my medical books?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I have, mum,” Hermione squeaked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good. Come over here, Luna.” Anne
waved the girl closer. “I've got pictures.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Okay,” Luna agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You too, Hermione,” Anne
commanded. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I've already read about this, mum,”
Hermione said quickly, desperate to find a way out of the situation
she'd found herself in. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That wasn't a request, darling.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, mum,” Hermione sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Good, you can sit on my other
side,” Anne said warmly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Harry was in the library studying his
wand movements. He looked up from his book when Phil entered the
room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Doing a bit of reading?”
Hermione's father asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Practicing a few spells,” Harry
replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thought you kids weren't supposed to
be doing that till after you graduated?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We're not,” Harry laughed. “On
the other hand, I just happen to have a wand that can't be tracked
and instructions to test it.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Useful.” He scratched his chin.
“Could you get more for the girls?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Best to wait till after we get back
to Hogwarts,” Harry said after a moment of thought. “I made the
one I've got and one of the teachers checked it out before I used it.
Rather not take any chances.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good thought,” Phil agreed. “Get
your coat, you're not going to want to be here for a few hours.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Alright.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna was fascinated by what she'd
learned from Hermione's mother. And so, in contrast to her friend,
Luna was intensely disappointed when the lesson came to an end. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would it be alright if I came back
with questions?” Luna asked hopefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, dear,” Anne agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Luna seemed to mull it over for a
moment. “Would it be alright if I came back with some questions
right now?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course,” Anne agreed. “What
do you need to know?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I did a bit of supplemental reading
after our talk yesterday and . . . . wait here,” Luna asked. The
girl stood up and darted out of the room. She returned a few minutes
later with a vellum covered book under one arm. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What's your question?” Anne
prompted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well, I just don't see how this
would be possible,” Luna said holding out the book to show the
engraving. “I don't believe either Harry or Hermione are that
flexible and I know that I am not.” Luna flipped a few pages. “This
one might be possible, but I'm not sure where we'd find another girl
that both Hermione and I would get along with.” She scratched her
chin. “Perhaps Ginny. But I am not certain I would enjoy having
Mrs. Weasley as a mother in law.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uh . . . Luna,” Hermione squeaked.
Doing her best to ignore the way her mother's face was turning red
and how the woman's frame was being rocked with suppressed laughter. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Hermione?” Luna looked up.
“Did you have a suggestion?” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Where did you find that book?”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It was under your bed,” Luna
replied. “Why?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If you girls will excuse me for a
moment,” Anne said in a trembling voice. “I have something to
take care of. I shall try to be back in a few minutes.” She barely
managed to contain her laughter until she was out of the room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>IIIIIIIIII</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil rolled up the partition separating
the passenger compartment with the driver and turned to Harry with an
unreadable look on his face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Harry, my wife thinks I should give
you the sex talk. Do you want me to give you the sex talk?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Already got it from Ron's older
brothers,” Harry replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Great, tell me if you have any
questions,” Phil laughed. “Oh, and don't be surprised if Hermione
or Luna have trouble looking you in the eye for the next few days.”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where are we going?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Fancy another visit to the club?”
Phil asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>They rode in silence for a few moments
until Phil could no longer hold in his question. &quot;So... which of
Ron's brothers?&quot;<BR><BR>Harry sighed. &quot;All of them, at
different times.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;What sort of thing did they have
to say?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Well for starters Charlie basically said
no doing anything anyone involved in wasn't cool with, Bill said the
same again and added in that anyone getting pregnant probably counted
as something someone wasn't cool with and, um, some charms relating
to that, Percy got way way too far into the legalities of all of it
but, y'know, that's what I expected since it's Percy we're talking
about and boy are some things about the Wizarding World disturbing,
and as for Fred and George they were all about how to not get caught
by Filch or some-such, and that basically ran to use a secret passage
instead of a broom cupboard or the Astronomy tower, and stuff that's
supposed to be fun. Though I'm not sure how that thing with the
Marmite and tweezers counts as fun; I think they were probably having
me on.&quot; He hoped they were having him on anyway.</P>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Amelia's eyebrows went up when one of
her Aurors barged into her office and began sweeping for bugs. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is there something you'd like to
tell me, Auror Tonks?” Amelia asked calmly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Two things, boss,” Tonks agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well I'm not going to say a word
till I'm sure your office is secure and that you're you, boss,”
Tonks replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Proceed,” Amelia sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Tonks used another dozen charms on the
office before raising the privacy wards and throwing a cup full of
water into the Director's face. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You had better have a good reason
for doing that, Auror Tonks,” Amelia growled. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Dispels any active magic on the
target,” Tonks explained. “Imperio to Polyjuice.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That bad, then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Gringotts slipped it to me along
with a bit of info,” Tonks agreed. “Voldemort is planning to hit
you this summer. Had planned to do it a few months ago but we got
lucky cause something else came up to delay it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's not entirely unexpected,”
Amelia laughed. “Is that all?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Looks like Harry Potter and
Dumbledore are also on the chopping block and it also looks like
there's moles in the Department and at Hogwarts,” Tonks finished.
“I've asked Madeye to keep an eye on your niece and her friend and
I'm not going to be more than three feet away from you till Voldemort
kicks it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're going to take that undercover
assignment with the Granger family,” Amelia corrected. “I can
take care of myself.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The Granger's head of security wants
a sit down with you and I'm not leaving you, boss,” Tonks said
firmly. “You kick it and who gets the big chair? I'd really rather
not work for that bastard?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;I have several reasons to want
you with the Grangers,&quot; Amelia replied. &quot;That they'll
shortly have enough wands to purge the department is only one of
them. Another is because I think having a force outside Hogwarts is a
good thing, a third is because it would give me somewhere to run, and
a fourth is because I'd rather not lose you if the Ministry goes
bad.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>“Boss?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The fact that you could double for
me isn't the only reason you got assigned to my protective detail,”
Amelia sighed. “How's the recruiting going?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Going good, boss,” Tonks replied.
“Grangers already have almost as many Aurors as the Ministry along
with curse breakers and healers. Better quality overall too since
they don't have to saddle themselves with any useless nieces and
nephews.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Which means there's no reason I
should join them,” Tonks said quickly. “Being your double might
not have been the only reason to keep me around, but it's still a
good one.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Amelia pursed her lips. “You say
Voldemort's planning to hit me this summer?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The goblins did, boss,” Tonks
agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then I have no need of you until
then,” Amelia replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Boss . . .” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'd much rather have you in a place
where you can easily keep an eye on my niece,” Amelia interrupted.
“You said they were also going to go after Potter and Dumbledore?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's the info I got, boss.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“They say when?” Amelia asked
intently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No, boss.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmmm.” Amelia sighed. “See if
you can get me a sit down with the Granger, I've got a few ideas I'd
like to bounce off him.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Boss?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“My ideas work and everyone is mostly
happy,” Amelia promised. “Even you, Auror Tonks.” <BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Understood, boss.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So why did the goblins decide to
share information with you?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Don't know, boss,” Tonks admitted.
“I was at the bank to deposit my pay when a couple of them started
having a conversation outside my vault.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I didn't know you spoke
Gobbledegook,” Amelia commented. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't, boss. The conversation was
all in English.” Tonks grinned. “On my way out, they gave me that
water, told me what it did, and asked me not to forget it the next
time I was there.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Curiouser and curiouser,” Amelia
murmured. “See about that meeting, Auror Tonks.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So long as you promise not to leave
the office without me, boss,” Tonks said stubbornly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Amelia's eyes narrowed and she allowed
the full focus of her gaze to fall on the Auror. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Right, boss,” Tonks agreed. “I'll
get Susan on my side if I hafta.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“On your way, Auror Tonks,” Amelia
sighed. “I have no reason to leave for the next few hours.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“On my way, boss.”

<P>Philip led Harry into the club and back
down the stairs to the richly furnished office belonging to his
friend. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Phil, Harry,” the man called out.
“Glad to see you could make it.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wife was having an important talk
with the girls,” Phil laughed. “I'm willing to do anything to get
away from that, even suffer your company for a bit.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good afternoon, sir,” Harry
greeted the man.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Call me Charlie,” he said easily. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Charlie?” Harry frowned in
confusion. “But the name on your door . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Was the name of the first man to
occupy my office,” Charlie explained. “His successor didn't
change it and now we're stuck with the tradition.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“And please don't discuss
anything you see or learn in the club outside the club,” Charlie
said with a twinkle in his eye. “We need to keep our secrets, 'eh?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No problem, Charlie,” Harry
agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Harry. I will say that
you've got a good eye spotting it like you did, most people don't.”
The man gave Harry an appraising look. “Ever thought about what
you'd like to do after you leave school?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not much,” Harry admitted. “Might
see if I can become an Aur . . . uh, policeman.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Might not be a bad career for you,”
Charlie said thoughtfully. “Then again, maybe we'll have other
options for you to explore when the time comes.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll be sure to explore them,”
Harry said with a grin. “When the time comes.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Charlie gave a booming laugh. “You up
for a game of gin, Harry?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Up for anything, Charlie,” Harry
said. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wonderful, have a seat.” Charlie
waved at the chairs. “You know how to play?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not really,” Harry admitted.
“Think I know the rules.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wonderful, we'll be on an even
playing field then and speaking of playing fields . . .”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How's your polo game coming along?”
Charlie asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think they're in for a surprise if
they expect me to play like I did last time,” Harry boasted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Been practicing then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Enough for it to start showing,”
Harry said proudly. “Hundred percent better than I was last time
which means a bit of time and hard work, maybe I'll be able to say
I'm a mediocre Polo player.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good to hear, good to hear.”
Charlie turned toward Phil. “You said you had a list for me?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thanks to Harry's connections,”
Phil agreed. “Number of people on it already work for you.” 
</P>
<P><BR>“Which is the only reason you
didn't snap them up yourself,” Charlie grunted. “Bet you would
have charged through the nose to hire them out to me too.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think you'd have found our rates
very reasonable,” Phil laughed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“As reasonable as the rates you
charged in your import business no doubt,” Charlie snorted. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Not so reasonable as that, I'd have
had more of the market cornered this time,” Phil replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Speaking of your import business.”
Charlie licked his lips. “Any chance your men could fill another
order?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Depends on what's being ordered,”
Phil replied. “Send me a list later and I'll see what I can do.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thanks.” Charlie broke the seal on
the deck and began shuffling the cards. “Mind doing me a favor,
Harry?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Depends on the favor,” Harry
replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And how much you're willing to pay,”
Phil interjected. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mercenary bastard.” Charlie shot
his friend a glare. “Hoping you could use those connections of
yours to get me a few things.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you need?” Harry asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Couple sets of what you gave
Hermione's uncle for Christmas,” Charlie replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You know Hermione's uncle Jim?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We work together” Charlie said
sourly. “Bastard is responsible for my ulcers.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Charlie is Jim's boss,” Phil
explained. “You can understand how fun that must be.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You have my sympathy,” Harry
laughed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So is it possible?” Charlie asked
intently. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Very possible,” Harry agreed. “I'm
friends with the inventors.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Think you could get me an
introduction then?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I think I probably could,” Harry
replied. <BR><BR>
</P>
<P>“Great.” Charlie began dealing. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We'll discuss Harry's rates, later,”
Phil said as he took his cards. “Bleed the bastard as much as you
can, Harry.”

<P>Molly was in the kitchen when the sound
of a dog barking drew her attention. She walked outside, no dog, and
the barking resumed the moment she walked back into the house. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Those boys,” the moaned. Now was
it an invisible dog or just a sound? She cast a couple quick
detection charms and followed them to the source which turned out to
be a large bull frog chewing on an old soup bone. “What in the
world?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The frog began growling as soon as she
got too close. This wasn't something her sons would do. Her eyes
flicked in the direction of her neighbor's house. And they'd wondered
why the land had been so cheap when they'd bought it shortly after
they'd gotten married.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Peaceful place in the country, two
sets of magical neighbors,” she mimicked the real estate agent.
“Perfect place for a  magical family my ass,” she muttered under
her breath.

<P>Phil threw down his cards in disgust,
that was the third game in a row. It had been a long time since he's
suffered such a long string of defeats at the card table. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's another game you win, Harry,”
he sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What about me?” Charlie demanded.
“Beating you was a team effort. And don't forget, this win means
that's twenty pounds you owe us.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What about you?” Phil replied. He
looked up at the clock. “I'm afraid I've got a meeting to go to for
an hour or so. You mind staying at the club for a bit, Harry?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't mind,” Harry agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Good, terribly sorry to do this
to you.” Phil stood up. “Be back as soon as I can.”

<P>Luna shifted closer to Hermione's
mother, basking in the attention. Things were better than they had
been in a long time, if only father and Harry were with them, then
Luna Lovegood's life would be almost perfect. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What was it like to go on dates with
Mr. Granger?” Luna asked curiously. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Knowing daddy, he showed up to the
date in a flashy car and took you to a meal that cost as much as a
house,” Hermione giggled. “Then, he took you home, kissed you on
the cheek, and you stayed with him to spite step-grandma.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's mostly accurate. But you
shouldn't be so quick to dismiss your father,” Anne advised. “He
once broke your uncle Jim's nose in a bar fight, you know.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Daddy got into a bar fight?”
Hermione asked in disbelief, eyes sparkling with interest.
“Wait-daddy broke uncle Jim's nose?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It was our first date,” Anne
giggled. “I thought he was a frightfully stuffy bore and had no
intention of dating him again.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I thought you said you got together
after the teacher made you?” Hermione asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's what started it,” Anne
agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So what happened?” Hermione
demanded. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your uncle Jim was still in the Navy
in those days,” Anne began. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So your father came back from the
loo to see to find his date being harassed by an uncouth uniformed
lout and demanded your uncle Jim apologize and leave us in peace,”
Anne replied. “Your uncle Jim refused.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And daddy punched him in the nose?”
Exclaimed in shock. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They growled at each other first but
you have the basics of it,” Anne agreed. “I called your father a
bloody idiot and said that he'd just punched my brother. Your father
apologized and offered to let your uncle Jim break his nose so they'd
be even.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then what happened?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your uncle Jim took him up on his
offer,” Anne said with a smile. “Then the bloody idiots left me
behind with the cheque to go on a pub crawl.” She giggled. “That
made me so angry that I promised myself I'd never so much as give
your father the time of day again.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How'd he get you to forgive him?”
Hermione asked quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“He didn't. Your uncle Jim stumbled
into to my apartment at five the next morning, dumped me out of bed
onto the floor, and announced that he approved of my boyfriend and
that I would be a fool to let him go.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Uncle Jim said that?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Then he vomited on my floor and
passed out,” Anne finished, smiling at the memory. “Your father
showed up in class that day covered in bruises and acting as if
nothing had happened. I found out later that he and your uncle Jim
had picked another fight in another pub after leaving me. Then . . .”
Anne dissolved into laughter. “He plops down in the seat next to me
and asks what I have planned for our next date. The bastard.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“And you've been together ever
since,” Hermione sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We have,” Anne agreed. She turned
back to Luna. “With luck, neither of your first dates will end like
that. I had a devil of a time getting that vomit out of my carpet.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You cleaned your own carpet?”
Hermione asked in shocked horror. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I was going through my solidarity
with the working class phase,” Anne explained. “Getting the vomit
out of that carpet cured me of it nicely.” 
</P>

<P>Charlie put down his cards when the
intercom buzzed and hit the reply button. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Someone to see your guest, sir. She
has a wand.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Show me a picture,” he ordered. He
turned his screen to Harry. “Do you know her?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That's Tonks,” Harry agreed.
“She's an Au . . . uh, Police Woman and she's also a friend.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Show her in,” Charlie ordered. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Tonks walked into the room with a
smile. “Wotcher, Harry.” After a quick glance around the room,
she  carefully placed herself between Harry and the other man in the
room. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Is there a problem?” the man
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I noticed that you were armed,”
Tonks replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's alright, Tonks,” Harry put a
comforting hand on her off shoulder. “Charlie is a friend.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm also on first name terms with
your boss,” Charlie added. “Would it make you feel better if I
told you that the lion and the unicorn were the best of friends?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It would,” Tonks agreed, relaxing.
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It would make me feel better if you
did the nose trick,” Harry interjected. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You've been spending too much time
around Madeye,” Tonks said with a smile, morphing her nose into a
snout. “Satisfied?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Partly,” Harry agreed pompously.
“I'm now fairly sure you aren't an impostor, which leaves a
staggering array of compulsions you could be under.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Brat.” Tonks reached out and tried
to muss his hair. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What can I do for you, Auror Tonks?”
Charlie asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Was looking for Harry and Mr.
Granger,” Tonks replied. “Got a bit nervous when I found Harry
without Mr. Granger.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You can track them?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I can track one of Harry's wands,”
Tonks agreed. “I can't track the other one and I didn't notice you
hide it up your left sleeve so stop frowning, Harry.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We've also restricted the trace to
the Director's office,” Tonks added. “That means me and Madame
Bones.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Would you be so kind as to do me a
favor, Auror Tonks?” Charlie asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Just call me Tonks, and it depends
on the favor.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I would like you to check my office
for magic and to put up something to ensure privacy.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I can do that,” Tonks agreed.
“Won't be as good as what the Grangers have, but it'll be
something.” She waved her wand, frowned, and waved it again. “I
take that back.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Something wrong?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“This place is almost as tight as the
Director's office,” Tonks replied. “Looks like it hasn't been
maintained or upgraded for a while though.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Tonks,” Charlie
replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Talk to Mr. Granger to get things
modernized,” Tonks advised. “They should be able to arrange some
top shelf stuff, even better than what Madame Bones is supposed to
have around her office.” But not necessarily as good as what had
been put in unofficially. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I shall,” Charlie agreed. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Which reminds me.” Tonks
turned to Harry and pasted on her best hopeful look. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“All I want is to assign you a
bodyguard or two,” Tonks replied. “And I promise that it's
because I've got an ulterior motive and not because I don't think
that you can take care of yourself.” Well, not just because she
thought he couldn't take care of himself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What is it?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The boss thinks something bad might
happen, I want to be prepared,” Tonks said. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Has she shared any details?”
Charlie asked eagerly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nope, she hasn't really even flat
out told me. But it's obvious if you spend as much time around her as
I do.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Charlie wrote out a quick letter and
sealed it in an envelope. “Be so good as to pass that along the
next time you see Director Bones.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Sure,” Tonks agreed.

<P>Phil stepped out of his car and took a
seat at the cafe. He was joined a few minutes later by a man in an
expensive suit. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You'll like this,” the man began. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'm sure I will,” Phil agreed.
“What do you have for me?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“An even dozen BMW R65/5s, still in
their crates,” he announced proudly. “Along with two dozen 75/5s
with the long wheel base, also still in their crates.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Very nice,” Phil agreed. “But I
asked for three good beginner bikes.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I got you those too,” the man
replied. “Three dozen Honda Cubs in crates, they came in a lot with
the other bikes and didn't even scratch the budget you gave me to
play with.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see, legal I trust?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Since when have you cared about the
law?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Since when have I not?” Phil
replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“That air force you had me get you a
few years ago along with all those tanks.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Let me rephrase that, legal in
countries I care about, I trust?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Nothing but,” the man agreed.
“Speaking of that air force.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Hmmm?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Got another contact in Russia, might
be able to get a few more interesting things.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Wonderful timing,” Phil said. “I
was getting ready to make another order.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What do you need?”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Give me your list and I'll give you
mine,” Phil said after a moment of thought. “Anyone selling
special munitions?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I don't touch that stuff,” the man
said quickly. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I wouldn't use you if you did,”
Phil said bluntly. “But I do wish to know if anyone is making
offers.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Gonna pass it along to the same
chaps you got the air force for?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Phil just gave the man a bland look. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Right,” he agreed. “Pleasure
doing business with you.”

<P>Molly stepped back to admire her
handiwork. Sitting in a corner of her garden was a miniature white
dog . . . er, frog house with spike written above the door in red
letters. To one side was a small pond and on the other were food and
water dishes. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Well, how do you like it?” Molly
asked. 
</P>
<P><BR>“Woof,” the frog replied. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Good.” She scratched him under the
chin. She'd gotten so lonely with the children out of the house and
her husband at work. It was nice to have a pet.

<P>Mandy's eyes were locked on the Death
Eaters in the doorway, what a time to be caught without her wand. Her
heart sunk when she realized that the other players wands were also
safely secured in their lockers. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Purebloods on one side, trash on the
other,” one of the Death Eaters barked. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What are you going to do to my
players?” the coach demanded. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“We're going to use them to send a
message to the league,” the Death Eater sneered. “Trained animals
have no place in a wizard's game. Quidditch is for people.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Mandy felt like she was floating
outside her body, like she was a spectator watching her own actions.
She was the product of a hundred generations of pureblood breeding,
the perfect woman according to the Dark Lord's twisted ideology. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Anything you do to my teammates, you
do to me first. I'm a muggle born,” Mandy announced proudly.

<P>“So am I,” the seeker cheered. “To
hell with you lot.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The other players rumbled their
agreement. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“So be it,” the Death Eater
growled. “We kill them al . . .” the man crumbled to the ground,
revealing an annoyed looking Ron holding a beater's bat. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron smashed another Death Eater across
the face with the bat in his right hand and drove his left into a
third's stomach. Three seconds had passed since the first Death Eater
fell and the Harpies had used the time their captors were distracted
to their advantage, the remaining Death Eaters soon learned why the
Harpies goal keeper spent so much time blocking penalty shots. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You okay, Ron?” Mandy asked, bosom
heaving from the excitement. “Ron?” her breath caught when she
noticed that his left fist was covered in blood. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yeah, why?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your hand.” Mandy took a step
closer. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It's not mine.” He loosened his
grip to reveal a carving knife resting on his palm. “Hope I didn't
ruin the edge on his ribs.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Oh.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Ron wiped the blade off on one of the
fallen death eater's robes and returned the knife to its place in his
pocket after a quick inspection to assure himself that it hadn't
suffered any serious damage. “Came here to give you your new bat,
Merry Christmas.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Christmas was last week,” she said
automatically. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Your bat wasn't finished till
today,” Ron retorted. “Suppose I could keep it till your birthday
if you'd rather.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“No! I mean, thank you, Ron.” She
snatched the bat out of his hands and held it to her chest. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“You're welcome.” He looked down at
the shattered Death Eaters. “This sort of thing happen to you
often?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“First time,” she giggled. “You?”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Quit a bit,” Ron sighed. “Always
figured it was Harry that attracted this sort of thing, now I'm
wondering if it's me.” He scratched his chin. “Or maybe if it's
contagious.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It was a very brave thing you did,
rescuing us,” Mandy cooed. “My hero.” She leaned in and gave
Ron a soft kiss. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Mine too!” one of the chasers
agreed enthusiastically, giving Ron a much deeper kiss before passing
him off to another of her teammates.

only things that made it bearable was the facts that Susan would be
leaving in a few hours, hopefully prompting Hermione and Luna's
return to as normal as they ever were, and the fact that Hermione had
never acted in that way before so her current behavior was likely to

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >We

Or perhaps not, the amended after seeing a hint of a smirk forming on
her best female friend's mouth. </FONT></FONT>

though. </FONT></FONT>

Harry said. Trying to pin down who had both the technical ability and
the desire that wasn't already in the house. “Harry, here.” He
listened for a few moments. “Yes, but the meeting I arranged isn't
for a couple hours.” He paused to think. “Put them in a waiting
room and tell Charlie that I would suggest sending for one of my sort
to make sure that they twins are not impostors.” He listened to the
phone for a bit. “Actually, a quick way you can do it is to ask
them where they got the money to start their shop. My Triwizard
winnings is the answer.” Harry listened to the reply. “No

heard it from the footman that was outside the door listening in to
make sure that Hermione's virtue was safe.” The man had nearly

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you,” Harry replied. He gestured for the twins to follow him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >How'd
you arrange to stay in such a big house, Harry?” Fred asked, awed
by the size of the place. It was absolutely massive. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >It
belongs to Hermione's parents, they're letting me stay with them over
the winter holdays,” Harry replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >The
butler opened a large ornately carved oak door and motioned for them
to enter the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Do
you gentlemen require any refreshments?” the butler asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
at this time, thank you,” Harry said after a quick confirming
glance at the twins. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Ring
the bell if you need anything,” the butler instructed as he closed
the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >So
what's this about?” Harry asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >The
twins spent a few minutes telling their business partner about their
meeting and the fact that it had made them realize that they were
over their heads. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >We'll
talk to Hermione's father about it, he'll know what to do,” Harry
decided. “Was there anything else you needed?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >You
know that Ron's started a custom broom shop?” Fred asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>“I
know that he was thinking about it,” Harry replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >He's
been contracted to supply brooms for the Harpies, beater bats too,”
George said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Good
for him,” Harry commented with a smile. “I knew he could do it.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >He
can't,” Fred said softly. “At least, we don't think he can.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Why
not?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >He's
got a bit more business sense than we do, but that's not saying a
whole lot,” George admitted cheerfully. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >He
doesn't have a good source of seasoned wood, he doesn't have
professional tools,” Fred listed a couple more things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >He
also needs a bit of ready cash to get started,” Fred said slowly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >We'd
like to set him up with our backer,” George agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Who's
your . . . oh.” Harry blinked. “Tell him to send his business
proposal to Hermione. When she thinks it looks good, I'll meet with
Ron.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >We'd
also like to toss in a few galleons,” Fred added. “We can't spare
much, well, unless this contract you set up goes through, but-”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >We
really think our little brother is on to something,” George
explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione
thinks the proposal looks good, I'll sit down with him. After I sit
down with him, I'll make a decision.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >No
problem,” Fred agreed. “Harpies adore him so they're willing to
wait. Other customers don't and won't.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Tell
him to stall for now,” Harry ordered. “Have him mention that he's
got a big custom order for the Harpies and that the best he can do is
put them on a waiting list.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Right-”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >-thanks,
Harry,” George said in relief, glad that the boy at least gave the
appearance of knowing what he was doing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >The
door opened and Phil strolled in with the girls closely on his heels.
“I understand you had a business problem?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >We
do,” Harry agreed. “I was hoping you'd let me pick your brain on
ways to screw Charlie out of more money.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Something
I'm always happy to see happen and even happier to help make happen,”
Phil agreed, grinning at the three boys. “Have a seat, Darling,”
he said, stopping Hermione from sneaking out of the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >But
daddy, business is boring.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >True,
but it allows me to make enough money to buy you those books you like
so much so I expect you to know enough to do it yourself after I'm
gone,” he retorted. “You can stay or leave as the mood takes you,
Luna.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
stay.” Luna grabbed Hermione by the wrist and dragged the other
girl to Harry's chair and onto the boy's lap. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Fred
and George watched as the girls made themselves comfortable.
Voldemort was so screwed and they were going to be so rich. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Amelia
looked up when the door flung open and someone wearing her face burst
into the room, turned, and began layering dozens of security charms
on the door after closing it and carefully engaging every one of the
locks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >What's
this about, Auror Tonks?” Amelia demanded, fingering her wand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Wards
at your place, tripped, Susan's fine with the Grangers,” Tonks
replied. “Get into the panic room!” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
sure I'm . . .” her jaw dropped in astonishment when Tonks bodily
lifted her from her chair.  The Auror then peeled back the carpet to
reveal a trap door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Boss,
you're either going to go in on your own or I can put you in. I
believe that someone is testing your security, I don't know that. If
they're gonna hit you, they're going to have to work at it, I refuse
to make it easy for them.” Tonks was breathing hard. “Now are you
going to go in willingly or am I going to have to throw you in?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >You
may have fifteen minutes, Auror Tonks,” Amelia said coldly. “Then,
the two of us are going to have words. Very hard words about your
conduct today.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I
don't mind you yelling at me, boss, so long as you're not a ghost
that is. Now get in!” She carefully dragged the carpet back over
the concealed trap door and replaced the chair. A slow count to ten
brought her heart beat under control. Time to see what she could see.

the Granger family's burly drivers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Susan
Bones just arrived with her security detail, sir, they say the wards
got tripped by something,” the driver reported. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >How
are ours doing?” Phil asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >They
say they're doing alright,” the driver replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >If
I may,” Harry interjected. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Please,”
Phil agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Have
Susan and the detail checked by your magical people to make sure that
they're them and that they're free of compulsions,” Harry ordered.
“If they are, Have Susan brought to the green room and have the
guards sent back to the Ministry if they'll go. Send someone to tell
Madame Bones that her niece is safe if they aren't.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Right,”
the driver agreed. “Anything else?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Nothing
I can think of,” Phil replied. “Anyone else?” he glanced around
the room. “Thank you, Thomas.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >No
problem, sir,” the driver replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Must
be trying to make up for what happened with the Harpies,” George
murmured, thinking aloud as he tried to process what was happening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >What
happened with the Harpies?” Hermione prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Death
Eaters surprised them in the locker room and were going to kill all
the muggle born and half blood players. Purebloods wouldn't leave
their teammates so the Death Eaters decided to kill them all,” Fred
began. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Then
our baby brother showed up to save the day,” George finished
proudly. “Walked up right behind them when they weren't looking and
provided a big enough distraction for the Harpies to close the
distance and take out the rest.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Is
Ron okay?” Hermione gasped. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Fine,”
Fred agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Better
than fine,” George laughed. “Harpies were very thankful for the
save.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Why
wasn't this in the Prophet?” Hermione demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Either
the Ministry is leaning on them to keep it quiet-” Fred said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >-or
it's because it just happened last night and they haven't had time to
print it,” George mused. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >May
I use your floo, please?” Luna asked. “I'm sure this is something
Father would like to add to tomorrow's edition of the Quibbler.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Go
ahead,” Phil replied. “I'm going to go meet with Madame Bones.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
go with you,” Harry said. “If nothing else, fame is useful for
getting past secretaries.” He turned to Hermione. “Would you mind
sitting with Susan while we're gone? I can't imagine that this is
easy for her.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course,” Hermione agreed. “Care to join me after you're finished
speaking with your father, Luna?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I'd
be delighted to,” the little blonde agreed. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Wait
here if you can,” Harry asked. “We'll all go extort money from
Charlie later today if we have enough time and his schedule is open.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Right!”

was quite distraught when she arrived here earlier, I dare say that
Hermione will not have changed that in the short time they were alone

be much easier to calm Susan than if you were not calm. Panic is very
contagious, calm is also, but less so. Do you understand?” Luna

answer. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >It
had been almost an hour since she'd set herself in the big chair, it
seemed like a year. Every second she was waiting for the door to

revery. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Potter

called back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Send

</P>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Who
does Auror Tonks belong to?” 'Amelia' demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Me,”
Harry replied firmly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >How
many men do you have with you right now?” she demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Ten
magical and my non-magical driver,” Phil replied instantly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Are
they in the office?” she asked hopefully. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Right
outside with yours,” Phil agreed. “I take it that something
happened?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >You
could say that,” Tonks agreed, allowing her features to return to
what passed for normal. “Be good enough to tell them to be on their
guard please.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >While
Phil relayed the instructions to his men, Tonks was opening the panic
room to let her boss out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I
said fifteen minutes, Auror Tonks!” Amelia shouted. “One five
which I'm sure you will note is a much smaller number than six bloody
zero. What in the hell gave you the notion that it would be a good
idea to lock me in there for an hour?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >The
fact that we've got moles in your security detail,” Tonks replied.
“I don't know what you're complaining about, boss. Your shiny new
hidey hole comes equipped with food, water, and a toilet. Posh it
is.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >You
forgot to add an exit,” Amelia said sourly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>“That
would have appeared two hours after my death or removal from the
office, which would amount to the same thing thanks to the new
wards,” Tonks said, feeling almost giddy now that it looked like
she was going to live to the end of the day. “Later if your office
was occupied.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >What's
this about the new wards killing you?” Amelia demanded, eyes
narrowing. And why hadn't anyone told her about that little detail.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >They'll
scramble my brains if you're hiding and I'm removed from the office,”
Tonks admitted. “We didn't have the time or the skill to finesse it
and I didn't want to chance betraying you with a loose tongue.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I
see.” Amelia glared at her Auror. “We will have words about that
later. What makes you think that my security detail has been
compromised?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Because
it has been, boss,” Tonks replied. “We caught two of our own
tampering with the wards, s'what caused me to burst in here. They
broke after one of the retirees did something to them that you don't
want to know about and I really wish I didn't know about and the two
faced bastards spilled everything.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Why
were they tampering with the wards?” Amelia felt faint, her
security was made up of her most trusted Aurors. If she couldn't
trust them . . . her chances of surviving to the end of the year had
just taken a major hit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Either
to prepare for the hit on your or to grab Susan to work as a lever on
you,” Tonks replied. “Not sure, boss.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Who
can we trust?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Close
security for you and Susan is all muggleborn, half blood, and
retired, pretty sure they're safe. It's the perimeter security that
our traitors came from and now they're all tainted so far as I'm
concerned,” Tonks answered. “Got ten here, five with Susan not
counting Moody, and another six off duty. Mr. Granger brought ten
more, plus his muggle bodyguard, plus Harry.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you for that and for looking after Susan, Phil,” Amelia sighed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Happy
to help,” Phil replied easily. “Also happy to suggest that you
and she move in with us indefinitely.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >She'll
take you up on that,” Tonks interjected, not giving her boss a
chance to reply. “Sooner than we'd planned, but better now than
never.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Auror
Tonks, I-”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
the boss when it comes to your health and safety along with Healer
Rage,” Tonks interrupted. “You're the boss when it comes to
everything else. If you have a problem with the way I do my job, you
always have the option of firing me, boss.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >True,”
Amelia agreed. “Keep the perimeter going around my house and set
the wards to record daily portkeys from here to there. Let's let our
friends think that I won't run and see what happens,” she
suggested. “I also want you . . . damn, you'll be at Hogwarts. Pick
someone to poke through the perimeter, leave the bad apples and pull
out anyone trustworthy. I'd rather not throw good Aurors away when
the balloon goes up.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >No
problem, boss. I'd also like your permission to trap the hell out of
the place. If the bastards are going to hit your house, I wanna make
them bleed for it, even if the place is going to be empty,” Tonks
said with a savage grin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Something
Harry's company is happy to help with at depressingly reasonable
rates,” Phil interjected. “Assuming of course that they aren't
too busy with their other contracts.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >You
have a company, Harry?” Tonks blurted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >We'll
talk about it later,” Harry promised. “For now, let me be the
first one to congratulate you on making Voldemort's hit list. It's
always nice to have company.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I
hear it gets lonely at the top,” Amelia commiserated with the boy.
“Here's hoping I don't take your place.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Here's
hoping you don't lose yours either,” Harry replied with a wide
grin. “How likely do you think it is that Voldemort's purebloods
would be able to track you if you used muggle transportation to get
to and from the Ministry?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I
can set it up so it looks like you're still coming and going by
portkey everyday, boss,” Tonks volunteered. “Would actually make
your scheme with the wards easier to pull off if I didn't have to
hide the extra trails.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Make
it so,” Amelia agreed. “Any other business?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >One
piece,” Phil agreed. “Hogwarts is being a bit difficult with
security. I've managed to suborn their Defense Professor, but the
Headmaster absolutely refuses to allow private security on school
grounds except in an emergency.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
have a talk with him about that,” Amelia promised. “Might take a
few weeks to pressure him into it.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Might
take less time if something happens,” Tonks said sourly. “I want
more men. Two thirds awake at all times, one third geared up and
ready to leave at a moment's notice, one third ready to go in a few
minutes, one third asleep.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Done,”
Phil agreed. “I'm going to assume that Charlie is going to want to
meet with you concerning this. We'll be by his office later today if
you'd like a lift.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Please,”
Amelia said. “One more thing. Could you have someone tell Susan
that I'm alright? She worries about me.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >We
can call home from the car and you can tell her yourself,” Phil
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Tonks
let her features shift back into her boss' face. “Let's go.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >You've
got my face again, Auror Tonks,” Amelia pointed out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Gives
the bastards an extra thing to think about if they try to cause
trouble,” she replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >In
that case, I'd prefer it if you looked like Harry,” Amelia replied.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I'd
prefer it if you didn't,” Harry said quickly, not wanting to throw
away something he recognized to be a potential advantage in the event
that things turned nasty. “They expect you to be here, they don't
expect me.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >So?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >So
there's a good chance they won't even see me if they decide to make a
move,” Harry explained. “Bloody hard to explain but I have
trouble noticing things that my brain doesn't think are important
when I get into a fight.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Tunnel
vision. He's right, boss,” Tonks agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Fine,”
Amelia sighed. “But if you get hurt, Harry, I'm going to make both
your and Auror Tonks' lives a living hell.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >So
long as we're all alive, you can do whatever you want,” Harry
agreed, unconsciously echoing Tonks' earlier statement. </FONT></FONT>

the man replied. “Will you be requiring anything else?”</FONT></FONT></P>

“Cards on the table, Amelia, we're both hoping to recruit young Mr.

now to save us all a bit of trouble later,” Charlie said with a
grin. “Forgive my rudeness, would you care for a cigar and
something to drink?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Please,&quot;

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Right
you are,” he agreed, pouring two tumblers. “Started drinking the
stuff on my midshipman's cruse and never gave it up.” He walked
back to his desk and slid one of the tumblers across to his guest.
Then, he opened his humidor and took out two massive cigars. “My
best man managed to steal several cases from Castro.” Did a bit to
make up for all the bloody headaches the bastard had caused over the
years. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Why

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Regarding

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Your

no matter where they originate.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >True,”
Amelia agreed. “There's also the fact that my department has been
bitten by forces from overseas before. We do not have much capability
to strike outside, but it is supposed to be one of the duties
assigned to the DMLE. One of my predecessors snagged it, and the
budget, when they were going through another round of

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
tell her, kid,” Tonks agreed loudly. Always nice to have influence
with people that had influence with her charge. Maybe they could get
the woman to take her security more seriously if they worked
together. Tonks gave a mental snort, and maybe they'd get a Minister
that could pour piss from a boot without the help of a dozen aides
and a hefty bribe some day. May as well hope for a manor house on the

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;That's
reasonable,&quot; the woman conceded. Her eyes flicked around the
room once more before she took her leave. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;So,
McLain, why don't you start by telling me how soft you've let

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
suppressed a grin when he noticed the looks on the faces of Charlie
and his retinue. He had them hooked, now all that remained was to set
it and reel them in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
what do you think?” he asked casually. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;We
might have some use for some of it,&quot; Charlie said, pasting a
look of boredom on his face. &quot;What's say you license us the
designs for...&quot; He wrote a number on a piece of paper and handed
it to Harry. “I think you'll find that more than reasonable.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
a good offer,” Harry said, glancing at the number. “Only thing I
can see wrong with it is the fact that you forgot to add a few zeros
onto the end.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
didn't,” Charlie replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
see,” Harry laughed. “Phil said you were a joker, I didn't see it
till now.” He wrote another number on the paper. “I think you'll
find this one much more realistic. That does not, of course, include
royalties or my own fee.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >George
glanced over Harry's shoulder and his eyes bulged at the amount. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >A
frown appeared on Charlie's face when he saw the number and he handed
the paper to Geoffrey who bore a look of disinterest on his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Pay
up,” Hermione's Uncle Jim advised. “Unless you can find another
source, he's got the market tied up.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
shall require your two inventors to make themselves available for
consultations I may further require them to make time for priority
custom orders if the situation requires it,” Geoffrey stated. “I
shall also require you to provide me with a preliminary order of five
thousand of each unit for testing purposes,” he added firmly. “If
you are willing to agree to that, I believe that we may have the
beginnings of a deal.”  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Can
you make five thousand of each?” Harry asked the twins. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >If
we can get some help, we can have them ready in two weeks,” George
said after a moment of thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Call
it a month and we'll do our best to beat the deadline,” Fred
corrected. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >How
much help?” Harry demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Lee
and the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team would be a good start,”
Fred replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Alright,”
Harry agreed. He turned back to his guests. “A month work for you?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
would prefer to have it sooner,” Geoffrey replied. “What
additional costs would it require to guarantee the two week
deadline?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >A
bigger labor pool to draw from,” Harry replied. &quot;We'll try,
but I'm not willing to make promises I don't know I can keep.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It
will have to do,” Geoffrey sighed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I

Harry.”</FONT></FONT></P>

Charlie.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
know he'd have gone higher, don't you?” Hermione's Uncle asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
prefer not to bleed him out all at once,” Harry explained. “You've
heard the story of the goose that laid the golden egg, haven't you?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Spent
far too much time around Phil,” Charlie laughed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Mind
if we duck out, Harry?” George asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
really need to get started on this order,” Fred agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Whatever

even think you might have a delay and I'll see what I can do to fix
it.”</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P><BR>

enough that we aren't going to be able to do anything but work and

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Gonna
need to bring in a lot of help to complete it,” Fred added. “But
it'll bring in more money than either of us have seen in our lives,
even after paying off our expenses and giving Harry his share,” he
finished excitedly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Might
be a better idea to reinvest most of it back into the business,”
Molly said, shocking herself. “What do you think, Arthur?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Depends
on if this order is a one time thing or if it has a chance of
happening again,” he replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Shouldn't

a portion of it into the business, save a bit of it, and celebrate
with a very small piece of it,” Arthur advised.  </FONT></FONT>

</P>

George turned to his younger brother. “Harry wanted us to deliver
this to you.” He handed the boy an envelope. “Should say
something about meeting with him tomorrow if you can make it. I'd do
everything I could to make it if I were you.” </FONT></FONT>

had a nightmare last night,” Hannah explained, noticing the other

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Oh.”
Hermione nodded. “Wake me up if it happens again and I'll join you

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thanks,

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Myself
as well,” Luna agreed. “We're all friends here.” She paused,
enjoying the warm feeling the truth of that statement brought. “So
I think I speak for Hermione when I say that we'll be willing to do
anything to make you feel better.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You're

absolute faith in the boy-who-lived. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;They

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Someone

replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It'll
get worse,” Tonks predicted. “Your Aunt Amelia's possible
replacements range from bad to terrible.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Main
thing I wanted to tell you is that Auror Tonks is going to be in
charge of your security from now on,” Amelia continued. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
about you?” Susan demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I'm
sicking Mad Eye on her,&quot; Tonks chirped. &quot;You thought I was
paranoid,&quot; she giggled. &quot;I'm taking your new detail, Mad
Eye and your old detail get lumped into your Aunt's. There'll be more
wands looking after the Director than there ever was in the past.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >More
looking after you and your friends too, Susan,” Amelia added. “I'm
also going to be staying here with the Grangers so we can pool our
resources.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Keep
quiet about that if you would, kids,” Tonks interrupted. “I'm
hoping to use your house to ambush anyone stupid enough to try to
attack your Aunt. Got a tentative contract with Harry to booby-trap
the hell out of the place.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Feeling
better about this?” Amelia asked gently. “It's still dangerous,
nothing in life is truly safe, but this is as safe as we can make it
given the circumstances.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,”
Susan agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Now
that everyone is on the same page, you lot have an appointment later
today with Ms. Jane,” Tonks continued. “She said you could do it
before or after lunch.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What's
the appointment about?” Hermione asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Your
friends are going to learn the dog pile game and you're going to get
a refresher course,” Tonks replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >She
yells down, you drop to the ground, and then she jumps on top of you
and tickles you,” Hermione explained. “Why are we going to do
that again?” She rather thought that she'd outgrown it to be
honest. Still, she didn't really have the heart to say know if the
woman wanted to relive the past. The woman had been a constant
presence in her life for her whole life after all.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
let her deal with that question,” Tonks said, amused by the girl's
obliviousness. She couldn't blame the kid, if you grew up surrounded
by security, things like that were normal. It was the world that was
strange. “Questions?” There were none. “Good. Now then, I was
outside the door earlier and I heard someone say something about
breakfast in bed?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yeah,”
Hermione agreed. “I figured it might be a good idea this morning.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
a good idea every morning,” Tonks said, kicking off her shoes.
“Budge over.” She hopped into bed next to Hermione. “Tell 'em
to give me a double serving.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Alright,”
Hermione agreed, amused by the older woman's antics. “Anyone else
want two servings?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Better
not,” Tonks advised. “You lot don't live the active life I do,
you'll swell up like balloons if you eat as like me.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >As
fun as that sounds, I think we'll put that off for now,” Hannah
said dryly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Looks
like Auror Tonks has everything in hand,” Amelia observed. She
walked over to the bed to give her niece a hug. “I'll see you later
today, Susan.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Bye,

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Bloody
hell,” Ron repeated. “No wonder she can afford so many books.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Explains
a few things,” Bill agreed. He reached over and pulled a bell rope.
“She doesn't see what the big deal is since her real house in
London is much smaller.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >How
big is her house in London?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Big,

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Have

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We've

started.” Harry held up a hand to stall the coming explosion. “They
also told me that they'd like to toss in some of their own, Hermione
is also interested in providing a bit of backing.” Though in her
case it was more to help out a friend and less in hopes of sharing in
future profits. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You

your skill level. After thinking about it, I'm going to add that you
probably need a better set of tools.” Harry raised a finger as he
listed each thing. “Phil has managed to track down a number of
possible sources for wood that you'll have to inspect before you
decide if any of them will be suitable. Says they're considered high
grade in the muggle world but neither of us knows enough to be able
to say if they're good enough to carve a broom out of.” Harry was
more than a bit ashamed to have to admit that last particular bit of
information. “If they are, you should be able to cut your expenses
by at least sixty percent.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That'd
be great,” Ron said brightly. “Thanks, Harry.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >As
for the other two issues, Phil has arranged a tour of a company that
works with wood,” Harry continued.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >And
steel,” Phil interjected. “It's a gunmaker, the wood is for the
stocks.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Gonne?”
Ron asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Phil
waved one of the servants forward. The man placed a long leather
wrapped case on the table and opened it up to reveal the velvet lined
interior. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Bought
this about one year ago,” Phil said, carefully lifting a
beautifully made double barrel over under shotgun out of its equally
well made protective case. “Thought you might want to get a look at
the woodwork before we go.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
incredible,” Ron whispered. A thousand times better than anything
he could turn out. “How did they manage to make something so
beautiful?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
hoping that the tour will give you an idea,” Phil replied. “If
so, we can arrange for you to spend a bit of time there learning the
trade.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That'd
be wizard,” Ron replied with a grin. “Merlin, I don't know how to
thank you.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Anything
for one of Hermione's friends,” Phil replied. He replaced the gun
in its case and handed the case back to the servant. “Be able to
get a set of tools or at the very least a lead on where we can get
tools during the tour. That done, you can start focusing on your
business.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >When
do we leave?” Ron asked eagerly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >After
we finish eating,” Harry replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hurry
up,” Ron demanded with a grin. “We've places to be and got things
to do.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
think I liked you better when you were a lazy unmotivated git,”
Harry said thoughtfully, regarding his friend the same way he'd
regard an insect in his soup. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
think I liked you better when you were an ignorant well rested
buffoon,” Ron retorted, chin in the air, looking for all the world
like an offended Malfoy. </FONT></FONT>

into a fit of giggles with the other girls. </FONT></FONT>

poured himself a glass of orange juice as the driver slowed the car.
Traffic was an unpleasant fact of life in London, he pitied the poor
buggers that were stuck behind the wheel driving themselves on days
like this.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Feel

spoken to a contact at Purdey and they'd also be delighted to give a

good for them anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >How

but they never stopped in the road like this.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
everyone has magic to get around traffic,” Harry laughed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >There's
such a thing?” Phil asked eagerly. “How much for you to arrange
it for my cars?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fifty
million pounds or your first born,” Harry retorted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Cheap
at half the price,” he laughed. “Let's see, you've already got my
first born, why don't we say I paid in advance?” Phil suggested. He
smiled at the deep blush that appeared on Harry's face. “To answer
your question, Ron. It all depends, shouldn't be more than an hour.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,”
Ron agreed. “Any advice?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Do
you have a sample of your work?” Phil asked. </FONT></FONT>

reached into his pocket and pulled out a half completed wooden chain.
“It's one of the exercises Madame Hooch suggested,” he explained.

</P>

his face. </FONT></FONT>

is cheap,” Ron replied. </FONT></FONT>

stormed into the Director's office, collapsed into a chair, and
propped his foot and peg up onto her desk. From his expression,
Amelia could see that this was not going to be a fun meeting. As it
happened, she was right. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Well?”
she prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Well
we're completely and totally buggered,” he barked. “You've got
moles, you've got corruption, and you've got incompetence. Quite a
bit of cross over in those three categories and the numbers of them
are much higher than the numbers of good reliable Aurors.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Segregate
the good Aurors, have them assigned to my security detail, Hogsmead,
and St. Mungoes. Put the rest into places they can do the least
amount of Harm like guarding the Minister. Find something relatively

she ordered. Damn it.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Already

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Healer
Rage wants to put me on medical leave for just that reason,” Amelia
admitted. “Unfortunately, that would give Fudge the run of the

that's looking more and more tempting if we can get the good people
out first,” Moody retorted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Been
abusing the confidential undercover assignment idea as much as

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Idea
about sending our Healers and Researchers to Hogwarts wasn't a bad

and Hogsmead.” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Azkaban
guard force is fairly reliable, swap 'em out with the corrupt,”

prison somewhere else.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >How
am I going to explain that to the Minister without letting him in on

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >There's
a disease hitting the island pretty hard at the moment,” Moody said
softly, leaning in so he could be understood. “Several prisoners
have succumb and all the guards are sick. Healer Rage, our Chief
Healer, recommended putting them all on an extended sick leave and
insisted on quarantining them and their families at an undisclosed
location.” </FONT></FONT>

prisoners?” Amelia asked. </FONT></FONT>

enough, they were all captured Death Eaters,” Moody replied. “To
be expected when one considered the fact that they're in the deepest
level of the prison with the most time around the dementors.

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
didn't say it wasn't necessary, I said I didn't like it,” Amelia
growled. “Bugger the idea of a second prison, I don't want to spare
the men for it.” </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >And
miss out on the valuable intel they're all carrying around in their
heads?” Amelia laughed. “No, I'm not suggesting we off them after

well placed bribe will get them out.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
are you suggesting?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Auror
Tonks put a new ward around my office that will scramble her brains

warmth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >She
is,” Amelia agreed. “I was thinking we either remove every one of
their memories before handing them over. Not like we can't replace
them if we come out on top, is it?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >And
bugger the lot of them if we don't,” Moody agreed. “I'd suggest
we also key them into the prison's wards, they leave without getting
keyed out and they leave in pieces.” He amused himself for a moment
imagining the look on the chief bugger's face when he realized what
they'd done. Might have the side bonus of discouraging more break out
attempts or causing the bastards to waste time figuring out counters
to boot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Can

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Grab
him, throw Galleons at him, and get it done,” Amelia ordered. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I

See if he can recommend someone else if he can't spare the time to do

by it and expressed his wish to come home to you girls.” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Isn't
that just the sort of unthinkingly sweet statement you expect to hear
from Harry Potter,” Hannah giggled. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Do
you know when he'll get back?” Hermione asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
was planning to ride back with Susan's Aunt,” Phil replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >No
more all day business meetings, daddy,” Hermione demanded. “We
only have a few more days of vacation left.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
see what can be done, darling,” Phil agreed. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It
was dark and they were nearly worn out by the time Harry and Amelia
finally managed to get back to the stately Granger Manor. Harry's
meetings had gone over long and while Amelia was no stranger to late
nights, the accumulated stress was making her feel her age more than
ever. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Upon
walking through the front door, Harry was immediately beset by four
frowning faces. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Are
you alright, Harry?” Hermione asked in concern, seeing the state
her friend was in. She took a couple steps closer for a quick
inspection to assure herself that he didn't need medical attention,
cursing the fact that she couldn't use her wand to cast a few
diagnostic charms. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Just
tired,” Harry replied. “Had to talk with Charlie about some
things regarding the contract with the twins and some other things,
then I had to talk to some other places on Ron's behalf.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,”
Hermione sighed. She nodded to the other girls, let the games begin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >About
time you got back!” Susan snipped, fighting down the grin that
threatened to split her face. “Do you know how bored we were?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
your job to keep us entertained,” Luna agreed, grabbing his arm.
“We get so lonely without you around.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
expect you to make up for your rudeness by being extra entertaining
in the future,” Hanna giggled. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
keep that in mind,” Harry said dryly. He reached into his pocket
and pulled out four packages. “Wear them in good health. Now if
you'll excuse me, I'm going to get something to eat and then collapse
into a chair.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
are these?” Susan asked curiously. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Mind
if I give the explanation, Harry?” Amelia asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Aunty
Amelia?” Susan squeaked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Please,”
Harry said. “Now if you lot will excuse me, I must be going.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione
shot one of the servants a meaningful look, causing the man to fall
into step behind Harry. It wasn't that she didn't trust that he'd be
able to get back to his room without injuring himself, it was that
she was more than slightly convinced that he couldn't do anything
without somehow managing to put himself into mortal peril. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Amelia
smiled down at her niece. “Didn't even notice me? I guess it's to
be expected that you'd be focused on boys at your age.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Um
. . .” the girl blushed a deep red. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >But
that's neither here nor there,” Amelia continued. “As part of a
favor he did for me, Harry managed to acquire a number of magical
artifacts.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
girls opened the packages to reveal four finely made silver chains,
each with a matching wire bracelet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
do they do?” Hermione asked curiously.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
can store items in the bracelet, they'll appear as miniature dangling
decorations. The necklaces will protect you against several minor
hexes and physical injuries.” She'd suggested giving them to the
girls after Phil had called with a warning about the planned ambush.
“I wouldn't suggest storing your wand in the bracelet, it takes a
few seconds to retrieve any items you put into it and that is not a
good thing in a fight.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
girls put the jewelry on and spent a few seconds admiring each other.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
think we're going to have to cut Harry some slack this time,” Susan
offered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yeah,”
Hannah agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Amelia
grinned, glad that she'd managed to do something for the boy to take
the heat off. She owned it to him after all. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ron
was relieved to find a car waiting for him when he stumbled out of
the Cauldron early the next morning. It wasn't that he couldn't make
his way in the muggle world, it was that the muggle world was a
complete mystery, so alien that all sense of normalcy was lost.<BR><BR>OK,
maybe it was a little difficult for him to make his way in the muggle
world, just a tad.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
driver opened the door and motioned for him to take a seat in the

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Purdey
today, Mr. Ron. Mr. Harry told me to ask you if you wanted to look at
a few more gunmakers,” the driver replied. “Also mentioned that
it would be possible for you to spend some time with a musical
instrument maker if you'd like.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'd
like,” Ron agreed. “Might be best to focus on the gunmakers first
though.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Can't
hurt to take a look at how others do things,” the driver offered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Right,”
Ron agreed. “Thanks for taking the time to drive me around like
this, especially since we should both be asleep right now.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's

was dragged awake by a cold sensation that told him some

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You're
lucky I wear something to bed,” he groaned, not opening his eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Lucky

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry's
eyes shot open to reveal that he was surrounded by girls, not a bad
place to be but the look of frank appraisal on Hannah's face was more
than a bit unnerving. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Do
you have anything to do today, Harry?” Hermione asked, hoping the
answer was no. She did not like how hard her friend was pushing
himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Charlie
wanted me to speak with the goblins on his behalf,&quot; Harry
replied. &quot;But . . .&quot; He held up a hand to silence her
before she could interrupt. &quot;I told him I wouldn't have time to
do that until after we returned to classes.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,”
the girl chirped, relieved by his answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
what would you four like to do?” Harry asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Daddy
told me that Thomas is qualified to instruct us on the proper way of
how to ride motorbikes,” Hermione offered, she'd already read
several books to prepare. “We could do that if everyone wants to?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Works
for us,” Hannah said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Myself
as well,” Luna agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Something
I've always wanted to learn to do,&quot; Harry said with a pleased
smile.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
settled,” Hermione declared. “We'll learn to ride motorbikes.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Great,
now if you will give me a bit of privacy?” Harry hinted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Right.”
Hermione blushed. “Sorry, Harry.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
smiled as he the four girls march out of his room. It was good for
Hermione and Luna to have other female friends even if it did make it
easier for them to conspire against him. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ron
held his breath as Purdey's master stock maker inspected his work. It
was times like this, after seeing the man's work and comparing it to
his own, that really drove home how far he had to go. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Adequate,”
the man pronounced. “I'm told you're planning to spend a bit of
time at Holland &amp; Holland learning the ropes?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Spend
a bit of time here too,&quot; the man ordered. &quot;I'm also told

very exclusive clientele?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
am, sir,” Ron said, unsure of how much he should admit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Keep
at it,” the man advised. “I look forward to seeing how you do in
a few years when you have a chance to get in some real practice.” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ron
left the gunmakers with another bag of scraps and another set of
tools thanks largely to the management's desire to stay on the right

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Mandy
walked into the Coach's office with an expression of profound
confusion. She was fairly sure she hadn't done anything she shouldn't
have lately and she knew she hadn't broken her diet, so what did the
bitch want? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
called for me, Coach?” she asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Have
a seat, Maxwell,” the Coach ordered. She stared at her player for a
few moments. “Just how close are you to Ron Weasley?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Isn't
that question a bit personal?!” Mandy demanded, rising to her feat.
“Who I associate with in my free time is my business and you can't
make me stop seeing him!” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sit!”
the Coach barked. “Sit,” she sighed. “I'm hoping you have a
very close relationship for the sake of the team.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What?”
She dropped into her seat. “What's going on, Coach?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
owners have decided that we need security in case of another Death
Eater attack,” the Coach replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
the labor pool's dry, we found three ex-Aurors that weren't fired for
gross incompetence.” You didn't want to be anywhere near Aurors
that had been fired for incompetence, not with the lax standards
foisted on the Department of Magical Law Enforcement by the Fudge
Administration anyway.  “Do you know what they told us when we
approached with an offer?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
a clue, Coach.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
told us that they'd already signed on with Harry Potter, he's grabbed
everyone the Department of Magical Law Enforcement hasn't,” the
Coach explained. “So how close are you with Ron Weasley?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Um,
we're just starting to get to know each other,” Mandy admitted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Let
me rephrase that, are you close enough to use your relationship with
him to get a meeting with Harry Potter?” The Coach shook her head.
“We're also going to try to get to him through Hooch at Hogwarts,
but . . .” she shrugged. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Might
be better coming from his best mate,” Mandy sighed. “I'll talk to
Ron, tell him what I want and why. What should I say to Harry Potter
if Ron introduces us?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Tell
him that we'd like to hire some of his wands,” the Coach replied.
“Find out how much it will cost us.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Alright,”
Mandy agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Here.”
The Coach slid an envelope across her desk. “Season tickets for one
of the private boxes. Present these to Potter with our compliments
before you ask for anything.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Nothing
for Ron?” Mandy asked innocently. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He's
already got a standing invitation to sit in the owner's box. What you
think he'd like, you let me know right away,” the Coach said
seriously. “Owners are set on getting you lot protected. Price is
still an object but not a large one.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Can
I get back to you on that?” Mandy asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

you should know before you meet with Harry.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What's
that?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
likes to be referred to in the third person . . . uh, never turn your
back on him, and if you're taller than he is, which nearly everyone
is, you should be sure to slouch or stoop down so you don't tower
over him. He hates that. And . . . uh . . . you should probably refer
to yourself in the third person too and end every sentence with a
preposition.” </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
long as they at least remain friends, he'll look after her. I'm
merely insuring that he has the proper tools to look after her

of them,” he replied. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Good.”
She leaned into him. “Your plan is just the sort of thing that I
expect from the heartless mercantile class, treating people like
chess pieces.” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harpies
want to meet with me about hiring some of my many bodyguards,”
Harry replied with an amused grin. </FONT></FONT>

have bodyguards?” Hermione asked in confusion. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
even one,” Harry replied. “Your father has hired several wizards
and witches, the Harpies think it was me for some reason.” </FONT></FONT>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Oh.”

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Just
means that Ron's going to come over for lunch with one of the Harpy's
starting beaters,” Harry explained. “The butler just came to tell
me that your father is wrapped up with something else and wanted me
to give them a quote for him later.”<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,
Harry,” Hermione agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
not a big deal. We have lunch with Ron, I give his friend a piece of
paper covered in numbers, and we get on with our day. Easy.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Susan,

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
would, but we can't at the moment, she's on her way to Scotland so we

weren't doing it for them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >A
few minutes later, Harry and Phil were just wrapping up their meeting
when one of their security people appeared to report the arrival of a
rather odd guest.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
do you mean by odd?” Phil asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
security person was gently moved out of the way to allow the butler
to enter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Representative
from the goblin nation here to meet with you, sir,” the butler
announced. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you, show our guest to our office, please,” Phil ordered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
sir,” the butler agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Care
to sit in, Harry?” Phil asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;I
would,&quot; Harry hedged reluctantly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >But?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >But
the girls are feeling a bit neglected now that Hermione's train is
gone and they've remembered I exist,” Harry explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Best
go back to them,” Phil agreed. “I did promise to give you back
after a couple minutes.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Glad
you understand,” Harry said, rising from his chair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Personal
matters before business,” Phil advised. “Never forget that.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
won't,” Harry agreed as he stepped out the door. Passing the butler
who was on the way in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sub-Chief
Chainmake, Representative of the Goblin Nation here to see you, sir,”
the butler announced. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Send
him in,” Phil ordered. He rose from his chair and held out his hand
as the goblin entered into the room. “What can I do for you
Sub-Chief Chainmake?” Phil asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;It
is what I can do for you,&quot; Chainmake replied, giving Phil's hand
a single firm shake while careful to keep his nails from scratching
his fragile human skin.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Oh?”
Phil's eyebrows rose. “Please, have a seat. Would you care for
something to drink or a cigar?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Later,”
the goblin replied. “I would prefer to conduct business before
enjoying your hospitality.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course,” Phil agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
goblin nation has decided to offer access to goblin werk maille and
goblin werk wards to protect yourself, your family, your staff, and
your allies,” Chainmake said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
accept,” Phil said with a grin. “Thank you. May I ask why your
people have extended such a generous offer?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Your
aid has netted us a considerable amount of profit in the past. It
would be a shame for your life to be cut short when you could
potentially aid us in achieving even greater profit in the future,&quot;
the goblin explained. &quot;Aiding you in protecting your offspring
benefits us in two ways: firstly, it makes you predisposed to view us
in a positive manner. Secondly, it insures that there is the
possibility that our people can enjoy good relations with your family
line in the future.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
best deals are those that make a profit for everyone,” Phil agreed.
“My first deal with you made me several million pounds and, I hope,
considerably more for you. May our future dealings be even more
profitable. Thank you for helping me protect those I love the most.”
 </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Could
we expect a similar amount of help in our relations with the human
government?” the goblin asked delicately. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Against
the magical, in a heartbeat. Against the legitimate government, no.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >More
than we had hoped,” the goblin said with a toothy grin. “Many of
your race seem to be loyal only to your race.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
am loyal to my family first, my nation second, my business partners
third, and the magicals not at all.” He pursed his lips. “Not as
a group anyway, several of them also fall into the three categories
as individuals.”  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Clan
first,” the goblin agreed. “May your enemies suffer, may your
coffers fill, may your family prosper.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;May
your foes die penniless, may your clan grow, may you be forced to dig
a thousand more miles of tunnel for a place to keep your gold,&quot;
Phil replied, getting into the spirit of things.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Now
that business is out of the way, I believe you said something about
cigars?” the goblin asked hopefully, licking its lips. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course,” Phil said, opening his desk top humidor. “Please, help
yourself.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
goblin selected a cigar and ran it under its nose. “Exquisite
scent.” It licked the tip and then took a tentative bite. “Cuban?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Nicaraguan
with Cuban seed,” he replied. “Quality control was a bit off in
the last batch of Cubans.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Real
quality matters more than perceptions of quality,” the goblin
agreed, taking another bite. “Wonderful.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Would
you like a case or two to take back to your clan?” Phil asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Please,”
the goblin agreed. “I hate to impose, but such a delicacy is rare
in the tunnels.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Phil
rang a bell, summoning his butler. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
rang, sir?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Set
aside a few cases of cigars for our guest to take back to Gringotts,”
Phil ordered. Making a mental note to give Harry the suggestion that
he might find profit importing luxury goods to the Goblin Nation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
marveled at the way Hermione and Luna automatically made a spot for
him on the crowded couch upon his return to the library. It was so
nice to have friends. He sat and both Luna and Hermione shifted onto
his lap.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Here's
your book back, Harry.” Hermione thrust the object into his hands.
“What did daddy want?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Just
wanted to make sure that I'd keep an eye on you for him,” Harry
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
thinks I need a minder?” Hermione asked, unsure if she should be
outraged at the idea or delighted that he'd choose her best friend
for the job. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Do
go easy on him,” Luna giggled. “He's a father so of course he's
worry about you.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Aunty
Amelia had half the seventh year Hufflepuffs watching out for us our
first year,” Susan offered with a snort. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Every
other year too,” Hannah added. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Just
accept that he wants you to be safe,” Harry suggested, hoping to
avoid angering his friend. “Less stressful for everyone that way.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,
Harry,” Hermione agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Charlie
raised an eyebrow when he found his car already occupied. Not that it
wasn't a pleasant surprise to see Amelia, just unexpected. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
think you might want to sit in on the Granger family dinner tonight,”
Amelia said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Oh?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >My
sources tell me that Gringotts sent a representative to meet with
Phil, I had a meeting with the Head of the Department of Mysteries,
it promises to be a very enlightening meal.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That
does promise to be an enlightening meal,” Charlie agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Mandy
didn't know what to think when she was called in for another meeting
in the coach's office. She'd given him Harry's note, what else could
they want with her? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Was
told to ask a couple questions about your meeting with Harry Potter,”
the Coach explained. “Nothing bad, we're just hoping you can clear
a few things up for us.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Shoot.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
mentioned the size of the house he was in; was it his?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Nope,
belonged to one of his girls,” she replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >One
of them?” the Coach asked with a grin. Seemed the-boy-who-lived was
a bit of a Lothario, to think she'd written the rumors off as the
normal garbage put out by the gossip mags. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
had four of them with him, not sure if they were involved
romantically or not.” Mandy grinned back, reading the older woman's
thoughts. “Not that most witches wouldn't be happy to snag
'the-boy-who-lived,' just wasn't clear.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Was
one of the girls named Susan?” the Coach asked intently, her smile
dropping as she remembered another, more credible rumor the owners
had passed on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Why?”
Mandy demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Because
we believe that one of his girls is Amelia Bones' niece.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
she's a big fan, we do something nice for her and maybe we can get
Potter to agree to another meeting.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >But
he did,” Mandy said with a frown. “Said any time after he goes
back to school.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That
wasn't just a personal invitation to you?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Don't
think so, Coach.” She looked at the older woman. “Something wrong
with the price list he gave?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
tell me that it's a bit too low,” the Coach replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
send someone to Hogwarts to talk to him that knows what they're
doing,” Mandy said with a shrug. “Easy.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Just
waltz in and talk with him?” the Coach laughed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Might
be best to floo the castle first,” Mandy amended. “I don't think
Harry would mind, he gave the impression of being just a normal guy.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >A
normal guy who commands a private security force as large as the
Auror Corps and who's defeated 'he-who-must-not-be-named' several
times in single combat,” the Coach said sarcastically. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
to mention a bunch of other things,” Mandy agreed. “Ron says that
Harry's a normal guy who has too much luck. Bad gets him into the
crazy situations and the good gets him out. Oh, and that trying to
cross him would be the worst mistake the owners could ever make.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
Coach snorted. “What's say we do this, we have the team sign one of
our game snitches and have you go to Hogwarts to present it to his
girl Susan. You sound him out to confirm that he's willing to speak
with one of the owners.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He's
got four girls, Coach, at least two of them were fans.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
can sign four snitches as easily as we can sign one,” the Coach
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >True,
but I really don't think we need to go to all this trouble, Coach.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Need
to or not, we're going to do it.” The Coach rubbed her eyes. “We
need protection and we need to deal with Potter to get it. Best do
everything we can to stay on his good side, 'eh?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Due
to the horror that is London traffic, Charlie and Amelia arrived just
as everyone was finishing their evening meal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
trust we've got something we need to discuss?” Phil asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
do,” Charlie agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
have the staff send something for you to to chew on to my office,
I'll meet you there.” He turned and was pleased to find his
daughter standing beside him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You're
going to have a talk about politics, aren't you?” Hermione asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
are,” Charlie agreed. “Specifically magical, normal, and goblin
and how we're dealing with them to resolve the Voldemort situation.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Care
to join us, darling?” Phil asked hopefully. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
wish I could, daddy,” Hermione replied. “It sounds like it would
be very educational. But I promised Luna that I'd help her chase down
the oil leak on her motorbike. I, um . . . I think she'd agree to
postpone it, I also think it would hurt her terribly if I asked even
if she didn't say anything.” It tore her up to see how vulnerable
her friend was sometimes.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >If
that's the case, by all means, stay with your friend,” Phil said
quickly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thanks
for understanding, daddy.” Hermione gave her father a hug. “I'll
badger Harry for the details later.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Alright,
darling,” he agreed, making a mental note that his daughter's
apathy towards all matters business did not apply to all matters
political. “Perhaps next time.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,
daddy,” Hermione agreed. “Bye, Uncle Charlie.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Goodbye,
squirt,” Charlie said fondly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
waited until Amelia had managed to extricate herself from her niece's
concerned embrace and the three of them retired to Phil's office. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
going to be joining us?” Charlie asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Should
be,” Phil replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sorry
I'm late,” Harry said as he walked in with Tonks, “just going
over some things about Hogwarts.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry's
got an absolutely brilliant map that we're going to have to try to
duplicate,” Tonks reported. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Who'd
like to start things off?” Phil asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
will,” Amelia offered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Amelia
has the floor,” Phil said with a grin.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
Department of Mysteries is under the impression that we're all
rallying under Harry's banner,” Amelia said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >In
gods name why?” Charlie asked. “No offense, Harry, but you
haven't even left school yet.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He's
'the-boy-who-lived,' the one who's faced Voldemort the most times and
lived, the hero of the magical world,” Tonks explained, listing off
a few of Harry's accomplishments. “Hermione and Luna were only able
to calm Susan the other day by invoking his name and telling her that
Harry had gone to the Ministry to rescue her Aunt.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Magical
world has a lot of faith in Harry,” Amelia agreed, lending her
weight to the explination. “Especially now that Voldemort is back.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Just
wish they didn't use that as an excuse to set around doing nothing,”
Harry grumbled. “Lazy buggers seem to think that they can just
leave everything to me. War would be over in a day if half the bloody
idiots picked up their wand and joined the fight.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >On
our side, I trust,” Charlie said dryly.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That
would be ideal,” Harry agreed. “My point stands either way.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Quite,”
Charlie sighed. “What does everyone propose we do about this offer
from the Department of Mysteries?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
recommend we accept it,” Amelia offered, “if for no other reason
than to deny access to our enemies.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Anyone
have an objection?” Charlie asked. “Motion carries, I suppose.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >On
to the next bit of business,” Amelia prompted. “What's this I
hear about the goblins coming here?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
offered to put a set of their own wards over the set we've already
got on the house. Also offered access to body armor for my family, my
staff, and a few close associates. I accepted.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Any
chance I could persuade them to include my Aurors?” Amelia asked
hopefully. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
see what I can find out,” Phil promised. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you,” Amelia said. “What's this about Harry's map?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >My
father and his friends made it when they were at Hogwarts, shows all
the secret passages and the locations of everyone,” Harry said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Anyone
who made it still alive?” Amelia asked. Her expression turned
contrite. “I'm sorry, I hadn't meant for it to come out that way.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Two
are still alive,” Harry said. “I'm going to make that one at my
earliest opportunity by removing one of the bastards from this
earth.” His eyes were blazing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >And
the other?” Phil prompted, coming to a sudden understanding about
why so many were willing to throw their lot behind a 'mere boy' so
long as that boy was Harry Potter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Works
for you, Remus Lupin,” Harry replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Supervising
the ward team at the London house at the moment,” Tonks supplied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
make a note to speak with him about the map later,” Phil said. “Any
other business we need to discuss?” He looked around. “How about
the fact that we've managed to drain most of the talent pool in the
United Kingdom.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Suggesting
we look outside our nation's borders?” Charlie asked with an
expression of distaste.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Private
individuals don't come with the same strings that they would if they
were supplied by foreign governments,” Phil pointed out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
know a few we might look into,” Amelia offered, “and I'd bet that
Moody knows a few more.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
something we should look into,” Harry spoke up. “Give us people
with different backgrounds and different perspective which could be
useful to have around.” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They'd
just managed to disassemble the engine when Luna mustered up enough
courage to ask the question that had been eating away at her self
confidence since they'd began. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Would
you have rather sat in on your father's meeting?” she asked
hesitantly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
if it meant breaking my promise to you or leaving you to do this
alone, Luna,” Hermione said firmly. You're my best female friend,
just like Harry's my best male friend.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you, Hermione,” Luna's voice caught, “it's very nice to have you
as a friend.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
very nice to have you as a friend too, Luna,” Hermione replied,
hugging the blonde. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Luna
went limp for a moment before hugging the older girl back with all
her might. She'd been so very alone before and she felt so very warm
at the moment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It
was just a bit creepy, Harry reflected moments after opening his eyes
the next morning, to wake up and find four girls staring at you. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
decided to let you sleep in this morning,” Hermione explained. Luna
was right, his expression was priceless. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Wonderful,”
Harry said. “What can I do for you?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
just wanted to make sure you remembered to pack,” Luna said
innocently. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It
would be awful if we missed the train because you forgot,” Susan
agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
wouldn't mind,” Hannah assured him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Alright,”
Harry sighed. He lifted one of his wands off the bedside table and
gave it a flick, causing all his loose possessions to leap into his
trunk. “There, all packed.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry,
you're going to get in trouble with the Ministry,” Hermione hissed.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Aunty
Amelia can probably take care of it,” Susan offered hesitantly, a
trace of worry coloring her voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >This
house is now so heavily warded that there's at least a ninety percent
chance that they wouldn't have noticed this,” Harry said with a
wave. “Then there's the fact that there are a number of adult magic
users present which adds a whole new level of difficulty for the
people in the underage magic office. Finally, to top things off, I'm
sure you all remember the fact that I worked out a deal with Susan's
aunt to give us a bit of leeway when it comes to underaged
restrictions. Even if none of that were true, this wand is
unregistered and untraceable.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Oh.”
Hermione seemed to consider the matter. “Do you mind helping us
pack?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sure,”
Harry agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Good,
because none of us have even started,” Hannah admitted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
do know that my deal with Amelia included you four, don't you?”
Harry asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
do, Harry,” Hermione agreed. “It's just . . .” her eyes flicked
to Susan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Just
because we can do something, doesn't mean we should,” Susan sighed.
“I'm not supposed to know this but Fudge is looking for an excuse
to have Aunty sacked or to take control of the Aurors away from her.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We're
trying to avoid giving him any ammunition to use,” Hannah
explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fair
enough,” Harry agreed. “Do you think it would help to let slip
that acting against Amelia would be the same as acting against me?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
ask Aunty,” Susan promised. Though she doubted it would, at least
not with the Minister, Fudge seemed to hate Harry almost as much as
he hated her poor aunt. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Good,
let's get you girls packed up,” Harry said. He rose from his feet.
“Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get changed.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Three
of the girls got up while the fourth, Hannah, licked her lips. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That
means I'd like you to leave, Hannah,” Harry prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fine,”
the girl said with a pout. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thanks
to the wonders of magic, packing did not take long. The group moved
down to breakfast, trusting that the servants would see to their
luggage. After their morning meal, Harry found himself being hustled
into one of the cloak rooms by his favorite pink haired Auror.<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What's
up?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Briefing
you on the security plan for the express.” Tonks handed Harry a
potion vial. “Open this or smash it if there's anything wrong,
it'll alert us and we'll get to you as soon as we can.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >How
much time to I need to buy?” Harry asked calmly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hopefully
not more than five minutes,” Tonks said, “we'll have teams
waiting along the route and another on brooms flying above the
express.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Nothing
on the train?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Afraid
not,” Tonks said mournfully. Damn Dumbledore to hell for how much
more difficult he was making her job. She'd personally tear the man
apart if anything happened to the kids because he wouldn't allow them
to maintain a close watch over their charges. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Care
to take a suggestion?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Shoot?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Go
to the crew, tell them who you are and who you're trying to protect.
Five will get you ten that they sneak you aboard.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yeah?”
Tonks perked up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Be
sure to stress that you're there to protect Luna and Hermione,”
Harry advised, “crew absolutely adores them.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
try it, thanks, Harry.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Don't
mention it. Having you close makes me very happy,” Harry replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Having
me close would make anyone happy.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >True,”
he laughed. “I'll refrain from pointing out that my ass is one of
the ones you'd be pulling out of the fire if the worst happens.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Such
a cute ass too,” Tonks mused. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you. I'm quite fond of yours as well,&quot; Harry stated, shocking
the Auror by retorting rather than blushing or stammering. &quot;Care
to continue the banter or should we head out?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Let's
go,” Tonks agreed cheerfully, always happy to have her attributes
complimented. “You know the plan we're using to get to the
station?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Nope,
no reason I should either,” Harry replied cheerfully. They walked
out of the cloak room and rejoined the main group. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Everyone
here?” Amelia made a quick head count. “Come on.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
walked out through the main doors. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Three
identical black limos with tinted windows preceded by two black
windowed SUVs and followed by two identical black SUVs pulled to a
stop in front of the Granger residence. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Everyone
in the first car,” Phil ordered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Why
are we taking so many, daddy?” Hermione asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >If
you've got it, flaunt it,” he replied with a grin. One of these
days he was going to have to sit her down and explain the security
arrangements and why they were so important to have for people in
their position. Or perhaps, it would be better to have her friends do
it. He reflected to himself as he noted Susan's easy acceptance and
Harry's careful evaluation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
got into the cars and spent the ride chatting about what the next
half of the year would bring. Consensus was that Harry would
accidentally rewrite the rules of magic and that they'd all be thrown
into another life threatening situation in the last couple weeks of
the year. Hermione did not appreciate it when Harry expressed his
hope that it would allow him to avoid sitting the end of year exams
again. Not even after he'd said he was joking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
convoy stopped at the station and the security people immediately
dismounted to clear a path through the crowds, making the trip to the
platform a breeze. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
walked through the barrier and Luna squealed when she saw her father
waiting on the other side. She'd been afraid that she wouldn't be
able to see him again before going back to school. The blonde bounded
over to throw herself into the man's arms. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
going to go find us a compartment at the front of the train,” Harry
said, giving Tonks the eye. “You guys say goodbye to your
families.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,
Harry,” Hermione agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>“I'll
help you with your trunk,” Tonks offered. She continued as soon as
she was sure that she was out of earshot. “How sure are you that
the crew will let me put people on board?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fairly,
don't know them too well myself, but like I said, they adore Luna and
Hermione.” Harry grinned. “All else fails I'll arrange an
accident for Malfoy and you can take the place of your dear cousin.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ug,
last resort,” Tonks said with a look of distaste. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
accident or looking like a Malfoy?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry,
I spent a week undercover as a hag, I spent two undercover as a
hunchback, I'm not sure my stomach could take even fifteen minutes as
a Malfoy. There are just some things not even Duty will force me to
do,” she said firmly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Had
to polyjuice myself as one of his goons once, can't say I enjoyed the
experience,” Harry agreed. “Might be fun to be Malfoy for an hour
though.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >How
do you figure?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
figure that there are three types of fun: there's fun now that's also
fun when you think about it later, there's fun now that's not fun
later, there's not fun now that's fun later. Being a Malfoy would
suck now, but it'd be hilarious to see the fallout of what happened
after I did my best to ruin his fortune and reputation.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >True,”
Tonks laughed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
stepped onto the train and quickly found the conductor. A short man
with a white beard who gave them the eye as they approached. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Do
you remember me?” Harry asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sure,”
the man agreed in a gravelly voice, “you're Luna and Hermione's
friend.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,”
Harry agreed, “I'd like to introduce you to Tonks, the head of
their bodyguard.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Pleasure.”
The conductor nodded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Pleasure
is all mine, Mister Conductor,” Tonks replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
can I do for you two?” he prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Dumbledore
doesn't like the idea of allowing private security into Hogwarts, I
don't like the idea of having them too far from the girls to do any
good if something happens,” Harry explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
doesn't want you on the train either, does he?” the conductor
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
doesn't,” Tonks agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>“Bugger
'im, what happens on the train is my responsibility, he doesn't like
it, let him talk to the company. They're welcome to fire me if they
think they can find a replacement,” he laughed. “Come on, we
already reserved a compartment for the Luna and Hermione's group at
the front of the train. Can't see any harm in giving the rest of the
car to the people keeping them safe.” </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Crabbe
was bored. It was the same every time they got onto the train, he and
his partner followed the twit to antagonize Potter, a wizard powerful
enough to go through the three of them without breaking a sweat.<BR><BR>The
boy sighed, least Potter was good enough to have his followers
respond with mostly low level hexes concentrated on the twit, though
often a few managed to slip by to hit his partner and himself. He
couldn't blame them for that of course. Accidents happened after all.
Rest of the train ride was always fairly relaxing, all they had to do
was pick the twit up, dump him in the compartment, wait for him to
wake up, and watch him sulk for the rest of the journey to Hogwarts.
Easy money. <BR><BR>Unpleasant, but at least the power disparity
meant their contract with the twits family allowed them to let the
little bastard take his lumps and ignore his demands to get revenge.
The boy snorted, as if they'd have a chance against Potter. May as
well ask them to take on a dragon armed with a teaspoon, the<BR>results
would be the same.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
noticed something was off when his partner nudged him. Things had
just gotten from bad to worse, much much worse. It seemed the rumors
about the Granger family were true, they weren't just poking a
dragon, they were walking up to one and repeatedly kicking it in its
reproductive organs. Both he and his partner went still, doing their
best to avoid making any actions that could conceivable be mistaken
for provocation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
grunted when he was hit by a couple stinging hexes, inevitable that a
couple of them missed the twit to hit the not so innocent bystanders.
 He nodded to his partner who set about the task of scraping their
principal off the floor while he backed up to the cracked door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'd
like to apologize for anything that either my associate or myself
have ever done to get on your principal's bad side,” Crabbe said
calmly, he swallowed. “I'd also like to state that the personal
protection contract his family has with ours will be up shortly, I am
going to recommend that we do not agree to a renewal.” No matter
how good the money was, it had just become too dangerous to take it;
what good was gold if you weren't around to spend it? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Smart,”
a feminine voice commented. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Please
contact me after that, the confidentiality agreement expires with my
employment contract and I would like nothing better than to dish a
bit of dirt on the whole damn inbred family.” He grinned at the
thought. “Should be able to say something without losing my magic
some time after June sixth of this year.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Appreciate
it, what would you like in return?” the unseen woman asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Either
a job for our families or help relocating to some place far away from
here, dealer's choice,” Crabbe replied instantly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
pass that along, pleasure.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you.” Crabbe stepped back to help his partner carry the twit out of
the car and back to their own compartment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Well?”
Goyle prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
girl's security didn't seem too annoyed with us,” Crabbe replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
about long term?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Told
'em we'd spill everything after the non-disclosure expired in
exchange for new jobs or assistance in relocating,” Crabbe said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Good,
can't wait to get away from the twit.&quot; He glanced around to make
sure they were alone and planted the toe of his boot in Draco's side.
One of the few good things about following the twit to bother Potter
every year was the chance it gave them to add a few lumps while the
twit was out. He glanced around again before kicking the twit again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Neither
can I,” he said, planting his toe in the twit's other side.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
happened?” Draco groaned an hour later. Damn, he felt like someone
had repeatedly hexed him before spending five minutes kicking him in
the stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Der?”
Crabbe replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Should

what's this I hear about you dating the Harpies?” he demanded. </FONT></FONT>

elbowed his friend out of the way. “How'd you do it?” </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Owl
the twins a Galleon each and you'll get the whole story,” Ron
replied without looking up, “and if you act now, you'll also get
the guide on getting the girl for free. Tell all your friends about
this limited time offer and you'll get your money back after ten
referrals, double your money after twenty, and triple after thirty.
For every five referrals you get, you'll also be entered to win one
of a number of exciting prizes. Act now, don't delay.” He squinted
at the block of wood in his hand, with luck, he'd managed to recite
the spiel the twins had made him memorize without making too many
errors. Well, he'd gotten most of it right away, that was good
enough. </FONT></FONT>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You're

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >If
I tell you for free I get on the twin's bad side,” Ron gave his

both of you. You don't want that.” </FONT></FONT>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Worked
out a deal with mum to take their NEWTs,” Ron explained, “means
they'll be dropping in at different parts of the year.” He held his
carving up to the light, the Harpies' crest was just starting to take
shape. “Also means they'll be able to come and show their
displeasure to anyone that gets on their bad side. You want me to
tell you and get us all on their bad side?” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I

a galleon each a bit steep?” Hermione asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Twins
say that even charging a galleon, no one's making a whole lot on ths.

felt a familiar sinking sensation as the train pulled into Hogwarts
station. Gone were his carefree days at the Granger house, he was
back in the hands of his Professors, back in a place where sleep was
considered a barrier to working out his latest mistake. Oh well,
maybe the new researchers Amelia had sent would distract them? Odds
were they'd make things worse, but a boy could hope, couldn't he?
Probably not, he decided. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
sight of his Head of House, Professor Minerva McGonagall standing on
the platform with an inappropriately wide smile on her face caused
the boy to break out in a cold sweat. When he identified the object
in her hand, he felt an almost overwhelming urge to flee. His life
had been difficult enough before, the addition of a time turner would
increase the level of suckage by at least an order of magnitude. An
idle part of his mind wondered for a moment if Voldemort's offer to

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You're

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Gran

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Bit

<P><BR>

</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you, Cousin Hermione.” The boy flushed with pleasure at the way she
instantly acknowledged their, admittedly distant, familial
relationship. “She also told me that she wanted to tell your mum
herself so don't spoil it.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Surprisingly,
the first day of class went almost without incident. The only thing

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not

the corridor with his goons. Time to give the squib a little lesson. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Something
you new money families never realized was that my purity comes from
the blood in my veins. Quality has nothing to do with my ancestors'
magic or lack thereof and everything to do with their nobility,&quot;
Neville replied calmly, noticing something that Draco did not, namely
that half a dozen of his house mates were standing behind the slimy
git including an annoyed looking Hermione and a completely impassive
Harry Potter. &quot;That is what makes my blood pure. Using the same
logic, yours is filthier than a sewer.&quot; Neville stepped closer,
invading Draco's personal space. &quot;Yield to your betters,
mudblood, step aside, or I shall be forced to dirty my wand in
dealing with you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >How
dare you. How dare you!” Draco was trembling with rage. The boy's
attention was caught by a snicker turned cough behind him and he
turned to berate his bodyguards before putting the Longbottom in his
place and froze, finally realizing the danger he was in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
know, I'm starting to come around to your point of view, Draco,”
Harry said calmly, “well, when mixed with Neville's,” he amended.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
not sure I can agree with that, Harry,” Hermione said loudly. “Mum
always told me that one of the most important things to remember
about coming from one of the traditionally important families was
that you never lorded it over your social inferiors.” She favored
the scion of he Malfoy family with a  look so condescending that even
her step-grandmother would approve. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
are of course correct, cousin,” Neville sighed. “Forgive me for
the shameful display I put on in your presence.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course, cousin Neville,” Hermione replied, playing along. “Though
I'm sure that there must be an exception for dealing with people as
trying as Malfoy.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Exception
or not, I'm sorry you had to see that side of me.” Neville turned
back to Draco. “Please forgive me for my earlier rudeness. I'm
afraid my cousin is correct, those of us fortunate enough to come
from quality should behave in such a way as to set a good example for
people of lesser backgrounds such as yourself. Now if you will excuse
me, I have business with my kinswoman.” He strode away from the
sputtering boy and into the group of his housemates. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
so glad we ran into you, Neville,” Hermione said quickly. “Mum
sent me a letter telling me that your gran wanted her to introduce
you to some of my female cousins.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >She
hasn't given up that idea?” Neville asked faintly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Apparently
not,” Hermione agreed. “I wanted to warn you that my cousin
Elizabeth is absolutely horrid, despite how charming she can act if
she thinks it will get her something. My cousin Juliet is very sweet,
but also very shy. And my cousin Annabel is . . . um . . . she has a
very good personality,” Hermione finished lamely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
see,” Neville said, trying not to show any reaction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;It's
not that she's hideously ugly or anything,&quot; Hermione continued,
showing that Neville wasn't as successful as he'd have liked to have
been. &quot;She's actually quite pretty, it's just that . . . well .
. . um . . .&quot; The girl's shoulders dropped. &quot;She's as dumb
as a dray horse.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Any

looked up when there was a firm knock on the door. She wasn't

What for?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I'm
not sure,&quot; Harry admitted, &quot;I think he was annoyed that I
charmed my vial to be unbreakable. He sometimes likes to drop them
and mark me down as not completing the assignment.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Did
you check to make sure that the charm would not interfere with the
potion?” She made a mental note to look into his remark about her
colleague. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
did, Professor,” Harry agreed, “the charm was in the potions
manual along with a strong suggestion to use it.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >And
he tried to give you detention,” she persisted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
did, seemed pretty annoyed when I reminded him that I was busy and
couldn't spare the time.” Harry choked down a laugh. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
remind Severus that I've decided to handle all of your issues
personally,” Minerva promised. She'd also ream him out if he was
still insisting on being unprofessional and petty. “What else did
you want to discuss with me?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR></FONT></FONT>&quot;I
need to schedule a couple of business meetings. At least one for
Hermione's father with the Harpies and at least one more with the
goblins on behalf of Hermione's godfather. I'd also like to attend a
couple of the Harpies games. You're welcome to come along for those
if you wish, Professor, they gave me season tickets for one of the
private boxes.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'd

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >No

Hermione and the other girls have a few things they want me to do for
them, but I don't know any details.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
speak with the others and emphasize how lucky they are for you to be
willing to grant them so much of your time,” Minerva agreed.
“Speaking of time, you're not feeling overwhelmed by the amount of
research and training you're doing, are you?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ask
me in a week or two,” Harry answered honestly. “I know what I'm
doing is important and I know that I need all the help I can get
since I've got all sorts of nasty people after my head, it's just a
bit difficult sometimes.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Use
your time turner whenever you need to take a kip,” Minerva advised,
“don't think they only reason I gave it to you was so you could
spend more time studying.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Will
do, Professor,” Harry agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I'll

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione
was waiting when Harry returned to the Gryffindor Common Room. The

face.  </FONT></FONT>

I help you with something, Hermione?” he asked. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry.”
The girl flushed with pleasure. “Daddy wants me to give a speech at
the coal mine he bought for me and Luna to play with. I was hoping
that you'd help me write it and go with us. I'm also moving my
locomotive to Hogwarts and I was hoping that you'd go with us for
that too.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Luna
going?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,

agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sounds

her. “What are you reading?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >A
complete illustrated history of the Hogwarts Express,” Hermione
replied. “Did you know that there's a canal to Hogwarts that was
used before the express line was finished?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hadn't
a clue,” Harry replied, “is it still there?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I

disrepair.” </FONT></FONT>

be something to look into later,” Harry mused. </FONT></FONT>

Hermione asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Harry,
that's perfect! Thank you!&quot; Hermione squealed. &quot;I
absolutely must be sure to write that down for my speech.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'd
stress that and job creation,” Harry agreed, “don't mention
anything about why the mines were closed. It was all before our time,
no sense tearing off scabs.” He pursed his lips. “In fact, don't
say anything negative about anyone if you can help it.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

supervised as Bill put up another set of wards over their safe house.
While not as extensive as the ones over the Granger homes, the

defenses. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
was privately amazed that he woke up late the next Saturday morning.
He'd have laid good odds that Hermione would have been overcome with
excitement at the thought of being reunited with her 'Precious' and
woken him up. As it was, he'd managed to get a bit of well needed
rest after spending half the night trying to figure out one of his
mistakes.<BR><BR>For once, it seemed that the universe wasn't
actively out to get him. Sure, it was probably just trying to lull
him into a false sense of security before the other shoe dropped, but
he was more than happy to take what he could get. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione
was waiting for him in the Common Room when he came down and she
immediately latched onto his wrist and dragged him out of the
Gryffindor tower. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Come
on, the others are already waiting,&quot; Hermione said excitedly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
found the other girls were clustered around a table in the Great
Hall, and they immediately set out at Hermione's insistence.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thought
you two weren't coming?” Harry said to Susan and Hannah. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We'd
never think of leaving our friends to do hard work without offering
to help,” Susan said, scandalized by the very notion. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yeah,”
Hannah agreed, not mentioning the fact that Susan had been having
nightmares again and that it was hoped that spending a bit of time
around Harry would quell them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
had to stop for a moment to get a good look at the train when they
got to the station, it looked quite different from the normal
Hogwarts express. To start with, the engine was different. While the
livery was the same, it was larger and the lines were obviously
different, even to his untrained eye. Following that was the usual
coal car, behind that was one passenger car, followed by a flat
wagon, and a giant steam powered crane. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >After
taking in the train, the boy took a quick glance around to confirm
that that the security people had already taken their positions on
board.  After that, they boarded and made themselves comfortable in
the one passenger car where they were soon joined by Tonks and the
snack cart lady. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It'll
take a few hours before we get to the section of track we'll be

to the precept that anything that could go wrong would, they were
unable to proceed due to a problem with a vital piece of equipment. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry,
they say that it'll take them at least a day to repair the crane,”
Hermione said, working herself up to tell her friend that he didn't
have to stay with them, she hated to see him go but his time had
become so valuable that she thought it selfish to monopolize so much
of it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >No
problem,” Harry laughed, “all you had to do was ask.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ask?”
Hermione murmured in confusion. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
boy drew his wand and concentrated on Hermione's small locomotive for
a few seconds. The crew watched in silent awe as the engine lifted
off the back of the truck and onto the heavy capacity flat wagon that
had been prepared for it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

Hermione whispered in shock. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Really
takes it out of you to lift something so large,” Harry panted.
“Tell me if you need me to get it off again when we get to
Hogwarts. I should be rested enough by then.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,”
Hermione said numbly, her mind racing to calculate the amount of
magical power needed to lift something so large. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Wake
me up in a few minutes,” he asked, yawning, “I'm gonna go take a

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Your

the four girls. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;He's

Right, Hermione?&quot; her voice was filled with absolute
confidence.<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
beginning to think so,” Hermione agreed faintly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Never
seen someone that had enough power in 'em to lift a fifty ton
locomotive,” the fireman added, “maybe Dumbledore could do it,
but not anyone else.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You

he can do anything.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yeah,”
Susan agreed, perking up. Feeling immensely better after seeing
tangible evidence of the boy's power level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hate

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You're

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
yet, I'm saving it till I get off the clock,” Tonks explained,
“then I'm going to spend at least fifteen minutes gibbering in
shock followed by several hours of heavy drinking. Now, I'm busy
looking after you lot and it would be unprofessional.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
secured the locomotive and woke Harry as they started the trip back
to Hogwarts. Susan and Hannah were a lot more bubbly and full of life
on the return journey, Tonks was as professional as ever,  while Luna
and Hermione spent the whole ride back chattering at each other in
incomprehensible technobabble over a parchment covered in
incomprehensible equations. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Unloading
the engine had to be postponed for a few hours since the crane had

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
said you wanted to relax today, so relax,” Susan said firmly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yeah,”
Hannah agreed, “why don't we all just spend the day with each other
in the library or something like we did at Hermione's house?” Susan
was glowing after spending a few hours with their savior so Hannah
was intent on getting as much group Harry time as possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sure,

weekend to himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We'll
meet you in the library,” Hermione said. </FONT></FONT>

you there,” Hannah said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione
and Luna rushed through the corridors to Professor Vector's quarters
and impatiently pounded on the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What?”
the woman demanded. “You do know it's my day off, don't you?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sorry,
Professor, but we thought you needed to see this,” Luna said,
thrusting the parchment into the woman's hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
am I looking at?” Vector sighed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

said firmly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fine,”
she sighed, squinting at the parchment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It
looks correct but I don't see why you'd bother calculating the amount
of magical power needed to lift fifty tons of steel and move it ten
meters, it's not like anyone could do it,” Vector said. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
did,” Luna blurted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

glad he's on our side after seeing that,” the former Auror agreed,

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
think we'd be able to do our duty, I also think that there wouldn't
be many of us left at the end of the day,” Tonks agreed. Your
ability to fight was based on a mixture of speed, power, skill, and

categories, but his power level was frighteningly high. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yeah,”
he agreed. The man handed over a file. “Big house is sending up a
dozen people to infiltrate the crowd and Bones says that we're to do
anything necessary save the unforgivables. Says we can always wipe
memories if we have to.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;My

was still frantically going over equations when Minerva arrived the
next morning, having heard about Harry's display from her favorite
student. The woman was at her wits end, none of it made any sense. </FONT></FONT>

</P>

Vector mumbled. </FONT></FONT>

you able to figure anything out, Septima?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
Potter shouldn't be alive after channeling that much magic,” Vector
replied, “which leaves us with a couple possibilities: the first is
that he's dead, the second is that the event didn't happen, the third
is that he's special, and the fourth is that he didn't.” She
yawned. “There are several others, but those are the important ones
for now. We can explore the rest later.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Go
on,” Minerva prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
haven't spoken with Poppy, but I do not believe that Mr. Potter is
dead, so until I learn differently I'm discarding that. There were a
number of witnesses to the effect and it is possible that their
memories were tampered with, so we'll place that in the maybe. It is
conceivable that Mr. Potter is special in some way that gives him
more magical power and more ability to channel it than anyone else,
but again, without consulting Poppy . . .”</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Poppy
says that Mr. Potter is a normal, if extraordinarily powerful,
wizard,” Minerva volunteered. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
we'll put that in the maybe basket too,” Septima agreed, “that
leaves the last and in my opinion most likely answer. Mr. Potter did
not channel the level of power conventional wisdom says is needed to
lift a fifty ton chunk of mostly steel.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
did he do?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Something
else,” Septima shrugged. “I don't know. Maybe he found a more
efficient way to use his power, maybe there's something about the
location, maybe there's something about the object, maybe Mr. Potter
uses his magical power differently.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
do you think?” Minerva asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
think he's using his power differently than most magic users do,”
Vector replied, “failing that, I think that everything we think we
know about magic is wrong.” She shrugged. “In any case, I'm going
to spend every waking moment of the next few months measuring and
recording everything I can about the event. I'm going to write a
friend at another institution that works in the High Energy Magic
Department for his input. I'm going to ask Mr. Potter to try to
replicate the event. But before I do all that, I'm going to get some
sleep.” </FONT></FONT>

and passed by the idiots without a second glance, purists a pox on

a dozen well rehearsed privacy charms.<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

cruel slit of a mouth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Greetings
to you too, father,&quot; the boy said. &quot;Why yes, I'm doing well
in my studies, thank you for asking.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fine.
Your mother is doing well, your sister is excited about Hogwarts, and
your elder brother is still a drunken wastrel and a disappointment to
me and everyone else in the family. Now what have you got for me?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Granger
and Longbottom have publicly claimed kinship. Seems that Granger is
from the aristocratic class on her mother's side and the ultra rich

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Any

</P>
<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not

not, I thought you had quite a bit of success with witches?”</FONT></FONT></P>

</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
you'd have to produce a new spare if I tried to do it in the usual
way,” the boy continued. “Even assuming they didn't detect the
potion, Potter would suspect something.” And then, if past behavior
was any indication, the younger boy'd kill everyone that might be
responsible including him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
remove him.” His father flicked his hand. </FONT></FONT>

long did the duel last?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Five

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Potter
sent him to the hospital wing.&quot; It had taken quite a bit to get
that piece of trivia. &quot;Used an unknown hex to do it too. Still

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >There's

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Or
we could wait and see if the Dark Lord prevails, he does we can
reexamine the situation. But so long as Potter is around, so long as
Potter could be around, I'm not even going to consider enriching our

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Even
with Potter out of the picture, there were still Bones, the
Longbottoms, the Weasleys, and the girl's own family to contend with.
It wasn't just playing with fire, it was juggling bottles of unstable

wanted no part of it, no potential reward was worth that amount of
risk. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Even
as rich as you say her family is?&quot; The man drooped, he could see

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >All
the money in the world means nothing if you're dead,” the boy said
simply. “We'll both be dead if we use the usual tactics. We'd be
stealing from a powerful wizard with no objections to taking the
lives of those who stand against him.” He rather respected that
about the younger boy.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Quit
using ten galleon words when knut words will work just as well,”
his father grumbled. “You're sure he'd get violent?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Am
I sure that Potter would... He's killed at least one teacher while
he's been here!&quot; the boy barked. &quot;And you're the one that
paid my ten galleon word instructors. What's the use of all that gold
if I don't use it?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
about business relations of the less romantic sort?” his father
persisted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
wouldn't suggest we risk it. A close relationship would give them a
closer look at how we do things and something tells me that they
would be less than enthused by what we consider normal business.”
And then Potter would kill him for being what he was around the other
boy's girls. It's what he would have done in the other boy's place
anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Feh,
weak,” his father spat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Yet
her fortune dwarfs ours,&quot; the boy replied, doing his best to
hide the relief he felt at his father losing grip on his position.
&quot;Perhaps it's just that they've gotten to the point where it's
more profitable to be respectable. Look how much the Malfoy family
spends trying to buy respectability, there's got to be something
there.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Lucius

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Because
Azkaban is a horrible place to spend a holiday.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You'd

“Just think about it, I will.” </FONT></FONT>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fine.

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >School
robes no good?” he asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It
requires something a bit more formal,” Minerva agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Be
right back,” Harry said. He rose to his feet and darted up the
stairs, coming down a few minutes later in a set of formal robes.
“How's this?” he asked, fingering the rich blue silk. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
don't know.” The woman frowned. “It lacks a certain something,
doesn't it? Don't forget, we are going to be representing Hogwarts
while we're there.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Should

wand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >No
. . . no I don't believe that will have the effect we're looking

clothing, do you not, Mr. Potter?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
do, Professor,” Harry agreed. </FONT></FONT>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
Professor.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Again
Harry went up the stairs and again he came down in a set of robes
which were again rejected by McGonagall. Over the next hour, Harry
tried on four sets of formal robes, a tuxedo, and six business suits.
Each in turn was given the thumbs down by his Head of House for one
reason or another. None of them solid. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Try
again, Mr. Potter,” Minerva ordered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
don't have any more sets of formal clothes,” Harry said. “All I
have is . . . is . . .” His eyes widened in alarm at the way his
Professor's grin deepened. “Please, Professor, not that.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
believe you said you had one thing left to try?” Minerva asked,
butter wouldn't melt in her mouth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Let's

have exactly the effect we're hoping to achieve.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
Professor.” Harry's last trip up the stairs rather resembled a
condemned man going to the gallows.  He came down fifteen minutes
later draped in the plaid of the great kilt she'd had him purchase
earlier that year, a garment he'd rather hoped would never emerge
from his trunk to see the light of day, at least not to adorn his
body.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hmmm.”
McGonagall flicked her wand, causing the fabric to shift. “Much
better, I think you've managed to find just the effect we were
looking for. Good job, Mr. Potter, take twenty points to Gryffindor
for good fashion sense.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you, Professor,” Harry sighed, resigned to his fate. He should have
known, he really should have known. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Now
come along, I appreciate the fact that you wish to present the best
appearance but your fashion show means that we have to leave now if
we do not wish to be late,” McGonagall said, motioning for him to
follow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course it does,” Harry sighed. Why couldn't it have been something
easy like a Death Eater attack? He knew how to deal with one of
those. Well, he thought to himself, at least it gave him an excuse to
carry a dirk. Never hurt to be armed with more than just a wand. </FONT></FONT>

nice for her Head of House for telling her what was going to happen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I

Colin's smiling face. “Right angle to get some great shots, just

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Good.&quot;
She grinned widely. &quot;Just remember our deal.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;A
galleon for every good photo, you get the only copies, anything you
don't want gets destroyed, I don't get to keep copies, I break the
deal and I'll be very very sorry because if need be you will make me
very, very sorry,&quot; Colin repeated.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Right,”
Hermione said brightly. “I also want a chance to poke through all
the photos you took in the past and right of refusal over any you
take in the future,” Hermione added. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
think we can do that,” Colin agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'd
also suggest that you give Harry a chance to go through them and tell
you the ones he'd rather be destroyed,” Hermione continued. “Agree
to that and I'll talk to him about not having all of them destroyed.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;You'd
do that for me?&quot; Colin asked brightly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
would,” Hermione agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thanks,
Hermione. Do you want to look over them before or after Harry does?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Oh,
Colin,” Hermione laughed. “Before of course.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course,” he sighed. She'd want copies of the ones Harry wanted gone
too as well he supposed. Ah well, he supposed it was still better
than what he already had. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
rather enjoyed the Transfiguration Trade Show, it was surprisingly
interesting and filled with the most . . . ah . . . unique people.
Chief among them was his Head of House, who showed a very different
side of herself when dealing with some of her colleagues. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ogden,”
she said with a grin. “So good of you to see you here. To be
honest, I'd rather thought you wouldn't have the nerve to show up.
Just goes to show that not all Frenchmen are cheese eating surrender
monkeys, I guess, just most of them.” She turned to Harry. “That's
why it's important to take people as individuals, Mr. Potter.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
Professor,” Harry agreed, jaw dropped in stupefied shock at how the
woman was treating her colleague. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Minerva,”
he said tightly. “Congratulations on you and your student here
taking this years medal. Just goes to show that a good student can
flourish even under an average-” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;What
was that?&quot; McGonagall interrupted, cupping a hand behind her
ear. &quot;Did you say that one of my protégés is rewriting the way
we understand Transfiguration while you're still stuck at a second
rate institution? Perhaps you should think about taking a step up the
career ladder and get a job slopping pigs.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;I've
never-&quot; the Frenchman sputtered.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Maybe
you should try,” Minerva goaded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
. . . you . . . you . . .” the man was overcome with rage. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Suck
it, halfwit!” McGonagall barked. “I believe you owe me
something?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fifty
galleons and a public admission that the Hogwarts Transfiguration
program is superior in every way to the one at Beauxbatons,” he
sighed in defeat. “It will appear on the third page of La
Merveilleux Diplomatique within the week.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Front
page,” Minerva growled. “That was the deal.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >But
. . .” He withered under her glare. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Front
page,” he agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Pleasure
doing business with you, sucker,” Minerva sneered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
haven't had the last laugh, Minerva!” Ogden growled. He glanced
over his shoulder at his anonymous students. “Shake your fists at
her.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
Professor Wernstrom,” the students agreed, hastening to comply with
his order. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >She
glanced around. “Come along, Mr. Potter, I think I see Tsveta
Dimitrova from Durmstrang trying to hide from us in that corner over
there.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Coming,
Professor,” Harry agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >By
the end of the day, they'd had several 'conversations' with Minerva's
colleagues which, if Harry's calculations were correct, had netted
the woman at least fifteen thousand Galleons in goods, gold, and
services. He couldn't help but think that he'd managed to get a
glimpse of the real McGonagall rather than the professional mask she
showed most of the world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
room went quiet and the lights dimmed. A spotlight lit up the stage
and the president of the prize committee took his place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Gentlebeings,
it is my great pleasure to announce the winner of this year's
Puddocky Transfiguration Prize, a young man who's contributed much to
our art despite his young age, a young man who's service to our
society and magic as a whole can not be overstated.” The President
took a deep breath. “I doubt that I'm surprising anyone when I
announce that this years prize goes to . . . Harry James Potter of
Hogwarts.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Get
up there and take your prize, Mr. Potter,” Minerva ordered,
punctuating it with a gentle nudge. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
took the stage and walked to the podium. “Thank you.” The boy
took the medal from the smiling President. “I couldn't have done it
without Professor McGonagall.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We'll
have her up here after you give us a few words,” the President
prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Uh
. . .” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Or
perhaps you'd rather give a small demonstration,” the President
continued, hoping to put the young man at ease. “It need not be
complex.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Right,”
Harry agreed. He drew his wand, eyes flicking around to find a target
before settling on the medal in his hand. A swish and a flick caused
the medal to twist into a golden gryphon for a few seconds before the
gryphon twisted itself back into the medal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Silence
hit the chamber like a train hitting pigeon. Harry looked up to see
that nearly every jaw in the room had dropped. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
. . .” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That
medal is solid gold,” the President gasped, locking eyes with
Harry. “You've just broken the third law of transfiguration.” The
President's eyes swept the room. “I trust . . . I trust that there
are no more naysayers? I trust that no one doubts that this prize was
given to Mr. Potter based on talent and not based on his fame? Mr.
Potter, let me be the first to congratulate you for winning this
years prize and please also permit me to offer my congratulations for
your win next year as well, but, if you'll do me a small favor?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Do
not strain yourself to think of a way to top what you just showed us
on stage, I do not believe my poor heart could take it. I believe a
round of applause is in order and after that, if Professor Minerva
McGonagall would consent to give us a few words?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >A
red faced Harry left the stage to the sound of thunderous applause as
a stern faced McGonagall took his place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Minerva's
scowl turned into a grin as she stepped behind the podium. “Thank
you for allowing me this opportunity, I promise that I'll be brief.”
She cleared her throat. “I saw him first yeh bloody baboons, he's
mine!” The old woman was glowing. “MINE! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!” she
began dancing a jig while making vulgar gestures at several prominent
individuals in the crowd. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;And
in conclusion I'd like to say, Suck it Wernstrum! </FONT></FONT>Thalla

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
was fairly sure that he was going into a state of shock as he watched
his Professor give her speech. By the time she'd finished, he'd
nearly managed to convince himself that it was all just a bizarre
hallucination.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Close
your mouth, Mr. Potter, it's not polite to stand there gaping at
people,” McGonagall chided as she walked up to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
Professor,” he agreed dumbly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Come
along, Mr. Potter, I know how tempting it is to stay at the reception
to.&quot; The old woman smirked. &quot;Converse with our valued
colleagues, but I know you have an event to go to with Misses Granger
and Lovegood tomorrow and I think it best that we get you back so
that we can retire at a reasonable hour.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
Professor,” he replied, trying to process the woman's sudden change
from one persona to another. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione
woke up early the next morning and rushed to the Great Hall to rejoin
the other girls at breakfast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P> 
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Did
you get them?” Hannah asked eagerly the second Hermione joined
them.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course,” Hermione agreed with a faint blush. “I said I would,
didn't I?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Only
after we twisted your arm,” Hannah laughed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Let's
see,” Susan demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione
spread the photos on the table as the other three girls clustered
around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
quite glad that you changed your mind about this, Hermione,” Luna
said, a dreamy look on her face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Mum
sent me a letter,” Hermione mumbled, her blush deepening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We'll
have to remember to send her a nice thank you note,” Susan decided.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >And
copies of the photos,” Hermione added. “She insisted.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
awoke with a faint feeling of dread. Something had just tripped his
finely honed danger senses and not in the usual way.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ron
must have eaten something really foul last night,” Harry decided. A
quick flick put up a bubblehead charm and Harry was ready to get
dressed and face the day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
found the girls studying together in the Common Room, raising a brief
eyebrow at the way Hermione had trampled tradition once again to
bring her friends from other houses into what was supposed to be the
heart of Gryffindor territory. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Guess
I shouldn't be surprised,” Harry mumbled to himself. Despite her
supposed love of following the rules, Hermione had never paid them
much mind when they got in the way of doing something she wanted to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
was that, Harry?” Hermione asked glancing up from the book the
girls were clustered around. A light blush dusting her cheeks as she
hastily closed the book and Handed it to Luna to conceal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Nothing
important,&quot; Harry said. &quot;How is everyone doing this
morning?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Very
well,” Susan said brightly, trying to keep the boy's attention off
their new photo album. “How are you doing, Harry?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Bit
drowsy,” Harry admitted. “Thanks.” He turned towards his best
friend. “Hermione.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
Harry?” the girl replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
. . .” Nothing to do but come out and say it he supposed. “Let's
see what you have on under those robes,” Harry sighed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry!”
Hermione gasped, turning a deep scarlet, he was being much too
forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
did remember that you have that speech to give today, didn't you?”
he asked, the corner of his mouth twitching. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Oh.”
She deflated a bit and Harry half thought that he saw a brief look of
disappointment on Hannah's face. “Right.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Your
da sent me a letter asking me to make sure that you wore something
nice,” Harry continued, “he also wanted me to point out that he
made sure the maids packed you something nice to wear so you don't
have any excuses. Your mum added that she wants you to wear the blue
dress and that there will be a photographer at the event with
instructions to get at least two dozen shots of you. I would like to
add that this event is for the people that are going to work in your
new playground and it's just good manners to show up in something
formal.”  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Alright,
Harry,” Hermione agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
about us?” Susan asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >If
you want to come with us,” Harry agreed. “Though your outfits
don't have to be quite as formal as Hermione's. Tell me if you don't
have something suitable and I'll see if I can arrange something in
the time we have.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We'll
be fine, thank you, Harry,” Hannah said. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
event was more interesting than he'd thought it would be, meaning
that it was merely mind numbingly boring so Harry amused himself by
watching the crowd. In the front row sat an assortment of local
notables, each secure in the fact that they were big fish in the very
small pond that the depressed economic area had become. In the second
sat an old man with his family, glowing as he whispered about his
time in the mines. In the third, he found something interesting.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
walked up to the nearest security person and tapped her on the
shoulder. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What's
up?” the woman asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Third
row aisle,” Harry replied. “Wand concealed in the small of the
back, anoher on hes left ancle, and I don't recognize him.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Give
me a second,” the woman said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Alright,&quot;
Harry agreed. He glanced at his companion and received a nod. &quot;Thank
you for your time.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ah
. . .” the woman cocked her head as she listened to her earpiece.
“Understood.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Well?”
Harry prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Gringotts'
internal security, not sure why he's here,&quot; she replied.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
think we're about to find out,” Harry said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hmmm?”
She glanced up to see that the wizard in question had stood up slowly
and had begun walking towards them, hands clearly visible with his
palms out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Noticed
you looking and I thought I might come over to set some minds at
ease,” the wizard offered calmly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Just
wondering what interest Gringotts has in this,” Harry said, eyes
flicking over the rest of the crowd. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >No
idea,” the mystery wizard admitted. “I'm here so I can give a
report on what I saw later.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
sent someone from their internal security division to give a report?”
Harry's companion asked skeptically. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
sent the nearest muggle-born,” the mystery wizard corrected.
“Internal security means just that, internal.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
do you do for Gringotts?” Harry asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Goblins
are a clan based society to some extent. One goblin watching another
from the same clan is likely to overlook the actions of their clan
member and one from a different clan has the possibility of starting
a feud.  Humans allow management to sidestep those issues,” he
explained. “Any other questions?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
do you plan to do if something happens?” Harry's companion asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Kiss
the ground and let you lot take care of it. None of you know me well
enough for anything else to work,” he replied. </FONT></FONT>

Harry agreed, he glanced at his companion and received a nod. “Thank
you for your time.” </FONT></FONT>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not

infamous Harry Potter in person.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
crowd erupted into applause as Hermione's speech concluded. The girl
had chosen to hit upon a number of themes in her talk; the return of
a small piece Great Britain's rich industrial heritage, the
educational possibilities presented by a working Victorian era coal
mine, and most importantly the promise of a number of jobs for the
local people. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
crowd's reaction seemed to take the girl by surprise. Red faced, she
stammered her thanks and fled the stage and into the waiting arms of
her friends. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
did great, Hermione!” Susan cheered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
quite liked the part about industrial heritage,” Luna said, eyes
shining. “Do you think we should set up a large steam engine to
help run the mines?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione
just gave a shy nod in reply, still feeling a bit overwhelmed by her
first public speaking engagement. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Think

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Really?”
Hermione's eyes were sparkling. </FONT></FONT>

'33 till I got conscripted and then again from '48 to '77 when I

sure how much use I'd be underground anymore,” the old man
chuckled. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
that,” Hermione giggled back. “Telling people what it was like
and giving tours.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >At
Harry's nod, one of the close security men handed the old man a
business card. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Think
it over and call the number on the card if you decide you want the
job or have any questions,” Harry advised. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
will,” the old man said brightly. He turned back to Hermione. “And
bless you for bringing the mines back, young lady, bless you.” </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
collapsed onto one of the couches in the Gryffindor common room
immediately after they'd all gotten back. He'd had no idea the event
would be so tiring, no idea how stressful it was to try to keep an
eye on so many people at once. It gave him a new found sympathy for
Tonks and her people. 'Poor bastards must be made of iron to be able
to do it day after day.'<BR><BR>Hermione, Susan, and Hannah took the
couch facing his while Luna bounced up and down on the springiest
chair.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Dobby'll
bring our meals up here, we've got the weekend to recover.” Harry
shot a look at Luna. “Those of us that need it, and McGonagall told
me to tell you that there'll be three extra beds in Hermione's dorm
tonight if you're not feeling up to going back to your own.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you, Harry,” Susan said with a wide smile. “I believe we'll take
her up on that.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Quite
considerate of her,” Hannah agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Wake
me when the food gets here,” Hermione mumbled, cozying up to one of
the other girls and falling asleep. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hooktooth
wasn't in the outer office more than five minutes before he was
called in to make his report. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Well?”
the other goblin barked the moment the door closed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >More
evidence has arrived suggesting that our theory the Granger family is
testing their heir is correct,” Hooktooth stated. “She has been
given control of a defunct coal mine and has stated her intention of
bringing it back to life.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
are her chances for success?” the senior goblin demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Very
High,” Hooktooth replied. “As things are she stands to make a
good profit when one factors in the tax breaks and government
subsidies she'll be receiving.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Starting
her slow then,” the senior goblin snorted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
expect that she will take on a larger project soon,” Hooktooth said
quickly. “Our analysts believe that she will be expected to find
her own project and that the coal mine is both a final test before
being set on her own and a consolation prize if she fails to meet the
family expectations.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Are
there any other possible heirs in this generations?” the senior
goblin asked calmly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;None
that come close to her ability,&quot; Hooktooth admitted. &quot;We
believe that the Grangers' back up plan is to find a suitable husband
if his daughter should not prove up to the task of managing the
family.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Likely
wants to find one regardless of how the girl does,” the senior
goblin replied. “It's never a good thing to deliberately weaken
one's blood.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >As
you say,” Hooktooth said with a toothy grin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
have any idea who he's chosen?” the senior goblin asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
believe that he's grooming the last Potter to take that role,”
Hooktooth said. “The boy has been shown to have a surprising amount
of talent for both war and business.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Two
words for the same thing,” the senior goblin snorted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >True,
but many humans don't seem to realize that,” Hooktooth pointed out.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >True,”
the senior goblin mused. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Orders?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Investigate
the other potential heirs and find a way to get someone close to the
current heiress,” the senior goblin said after a moment of thought.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
want a source of information close to the heiress?” Hooktooth
asked, hoping to clarify things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
want to provide a minor amount of aid to the heiress, one that will
keep her friendly towards the goblin nation should she prove worthy.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Without
being so useful that it will annoy her father and make him believe
that we are trying to influence his test,” Hooktooth finished. “I
think I have an idea on how to accomplish that.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Good,
dismissed.” </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Mandy
tumbled out of the Three Broomsticks fireplace and into Ron's waiting
arms. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Almost
as bad as Harry,” Ron laughed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
because of all the time we spend on brooms,” Mandy said, dusting
herself off with as much dignity as she could muster. “Better you
are on a broom the worse you are at floo. No professional Quidditch
player makes a good landing.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Really?”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >No,
I'm just awful at it,” Mandy snorted. “Good to know that I'm not
the only one.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Didn't
expect to see you today,” Ron told the girl with a smile. “What
with the game on and all.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
because there's a game on today that I came to see you,” Mandy
said. “I sprained my wrist in practice yesterday so I won't be
playing.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
not serious is it?” Ron asked in concern. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It'll
be fine in a couple days, I could still play but the coach wants to
be safe.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
. . . I was wondering, would you like to watch the match with me?”
she asked hopefully.  “You can chose between the bench with the
players and the owner's box.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Should
be able to make it.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Great,
here then. You don't want to be anywhere near the stadium when
they're ramping up for a game,&quot; Mandy said with a grin. &quot;Why
don't we . . . Damn it!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Either
works for me,” Ron replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
is it?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
forgot that I had to talk with Harry, it's the only way the coach was
willing to let me skip out on the pre-game. Sorry, Ron, but I promise
it won't take more than five minutes.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
about?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;The
owners want me to make double sure he's willing to talk and then they
want to give him and his girls tickets to the owners box,&quot; she
replied. &quot;If he ends up going, they're hoping to meet with him
and sound him out on what they'll have to do to close the deal.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
found Harry in the Great Hall sitting in front of his half finished
breakfast sandwiched between Luna and Hermione across from the two
Hufflepuffs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Have
a seat, Ron,” Hermione said, patting the empty space next to her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Had
breakfast at the Broomsticks,” Ron replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I've
got standing permission to leave if it's related to my business or
training,” Ron replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Meeting
your girlfriend is business related?” Hermione asked, winking at
the girl in question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It
is when she represents his biggest client,” Mandy agreed, resisting
the urge to squeal at the way Ron's face darkened to match his hair.
“Speaking of the Harpies, I need to speak with you about something,
Harry.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Shoot.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
owners want to make sure that you're willing to talk to them and not
just me,” Mandy stated. “I told them you were a normal guy, but
they're having trouble believing that you'd be willing to have a sit
down just because I asked.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
still willing to meet with them,” Harry assured the girl. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
know, but orders are orders.” She blinked. “Almost forgot.” She
dug around her pockets and pulled out four golden sniches, handing
one to each girl. “Game snitches signed by the team. I'm to give
them to you in front of Harry to get on your good side in hopes that,
that will get me on his.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank
you,” Hermione said primly. Susan and Hannah just nodded, unable to
speak, eyes sparkling in pleasure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
thank you very much,” Luna agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That
said, you're all invited to today's game. Seats in the owners box so
they can run into you by coincidence and strike up a conversation.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Convenient,”
Harry said. “Accepted if I can get permission to leave.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >McGonagall's
at the head table,” Hermione pointed out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
she is,” Harry agreed. The boy shoveled in the last bit of food
into his mouth and chewed it as he walked to meet his Head of House. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
Mr. Potter?” the old woman raised an eyebrow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Hmmmm
. . . I'd like to give it, but I'm not sure it would be prudent to
let you go unaccompanied. I realize, Mr. Potter, that you would be a
perfect gentleman, but there are . . . Do you find this conversation
amusing, Mr. Potter?&quot; McGonagall asked, giving him her patented
number four look. The one she normally gave students caught casting
spells in the halls.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>

going,” Hooch replied. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
be in the dugout,” Hooch said with a grin. “They're still trying

can.” </FONT></FONT>

a nod of acknowledgement, Harry spun on his heel and returned to the
group.</FONT></FONT></P>

Mandy asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Room
for one more?” Harry asked hopefully. “One of the Professors
wants to go along as a chaperone.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Who?”
Mandy squinted at the Head Table. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Professor
McGonagall, third from the left,” Harry replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Merlin,”
Mandy gasped. “I mean . . . just, Merlin.” She shook her head.
“Harry, could . . . could you introduce us?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
led the girl to the Head Table, stopping in front of his Head of
House. “Professor, I'd like to introduce you to Mandy. Mandy,
Professor McGonagall.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >A

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I
. . . It's an honor to meet you, Ms. McGonagall,&quot; Mandy gushed.
&quot;An honor.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;You're a fan of Transfiguration?&quot;
Minerva's eyebrows rose. She'd never run into a transfiguration
groupie outside one of the trade conventions.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
a beater, first string for the Harpies. I never thought . . . I never
dreamed I'd meet the real Cannon Ball Mc-gone-a-gall. I've seen all
your old games, you were amazing.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
sure there have been better,” Minerva demurred, clearly pleased by
what the girl was saying. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
still hold the league record for the most fouls in one minute, game,
season, and career,” Mandy said quickly. “And the team record for
the most ulcers given to the coach. You're a legend.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
glad someone still remembers me,” McGonagall replied, clearly
pleased by what she was hearing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Would
you like to spend the game in the dugout?” Mandy asked hopefully.
“I know the other players would love to meet you.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
suppose it's settled then,” McGonagall said. “Be sure to wear
your winter cloaks, even if they have managed to solve the problem
with the heat, it'll still be cold going to and from the stadium.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,

and a half hours,” McGonagall agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,
Professor,” Harry agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>“Could
you make that three and meet at the Three Broomsticks?” Mandy asked
hopefully. “I've got a portkey that'll take us to one of the
private arrival areas.” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Alright,”

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Three
hours later, the group met up at the Hogsmead's finest drinking

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >A

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
all know Mr. Weasley and we're all very grateful for what he's
already done for the team,” Christine agreed. She turned to the two
professors. “And of course we're always pleased to see former
players return to see the team play.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They're
gonna be in the dugout with me and Ron,” Mandy chirped. “Harry
and the girls are going to the box.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course,” Christine agreed. “Your coach asked me to direct your
party to the locker room, Mandy.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Got
it,” Mandy agreed. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
woman turned back to Harry. &quot;Why don't I show you the way,&quot;

one of the chasers squealed. “You made it.” The girl darted over

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >To
Harry's surprise, he was able to enjoy almost half the game before
the subject of business was brought up. Tired of the owners dancing
around the issue and wanting to get back to the game, Harry decided
to just get things into the open. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
got my estimate, didn't you?” Harry asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
did, Mr. Potter. We were hoping you'd be able to give us hard numbers
in this meeting,” one of the owners replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
going to want a few concessions in addition to the gold,” Harry
cautioned. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
sort of concessions?” another of the owners asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Tickets
for employees mainly,” Harry said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Shouldn't
be a problem,” the third owner replied. “Might be a good idea to
give free tickets to Aurors as well, always good to have more guards
around.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We'll
throw in a number of tickets for family members also,” the first
suggested, also liking the idea of having a number of dangerous and
trustworthy magic users sprinkled about the crowd. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Anything
else, Mr. Potter?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That's
the main thing, might want to borrow the team a couple times in the
future or at least some of the players.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Benefits,
that sort of thing?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,”
Harry agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Give
us a number to start with,” the owner requested. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
can do it for this much, only place I can go from it is up so.”
Harry wrote a number on a piece of paper and handed it to the owners.
“Take it or leave it.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Why
so cheap?” one of the owners asked after some discussion with his
fellows. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Several
reasons,” Harry replied. “Big one is my best mate, someone who's
saved my life a number of times and someone who's life I've saved a
number of times in turn, is dating one of your beaters. Keeping her
safe makes him happy.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >How
much to add in a half dozen women to keep an eye on the locker
rooms?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
added another figure to the paper. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Done,”
the second owner agreed. “Have your solicitor send us a contract
please, Mr. Potter.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
will,” Harry agreed, making a mental note to get a solicitor. “Now
if you gentlemen will excuse me, I'd like to get back to the game.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course.” </FONT></FONT>

Hermione?” </FONT></FONT>

eyes sparkling with amusement. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >My
best girl,” Harry replied, eliciting a deep blush from the girl. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >If
Hermione's your best girl, what does that make us?” Hannah
challenged. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
realize that I'm you girl's chief source of entertainment, but could
we get back to that after the game?” Harry requested. “I really
do want to see the rest of it.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Okay,
Harry,” Hermione chirped. </FONT></FONT>

Harry,” Susan added. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >No

reread the letter from his gran, knowing that this was all Hermione's

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
am I supposed to do on a muggle date?” Neville sighed. A couple
barely remembered muggle studies classes under his belt from before
he'd dropped the course and he could barely read a bus map. Still,
his eyes drifted over the photo that had been included in the

something nice to look at while the world fell around his ears. </FONT></FONT>

smiled as she reclaimed her old spot on the bench. The old woman
marveled at the fact that it was just as knotty and uncomfortable as
it had been when she was on the team. Seemed the current generation
of owners was as reluctant to spend gold on team comfort as hers had
been, or perhaps they wanted to encourage players by making the time
spent out of the game as unpleasant as possible.<BR><BR>The mistress
of Transfiguration was torn from her musings when two burly women

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>Harry
was immediately confronted by a nervous Neville when he walked
through the portrait hole and back into the Gryffindor Common
Room.<BR><BR>&quot;What am I gonna do, Harry?&quot; Neville demanded,
hoping the other boy would have some advice to share or some way out
of the predicament he'd been unwillingly thrust into.<BR><BR>&quot;About
what, Neville?&quot; Harry asked, hoping to make sense of what was
happening.<BR><BR>&quot;My gran sent me a letter,&quot; Neville
began.<BR><BR>&quot;Yes?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;I'm going on a date with
one of Hermione's cousins next week and I don't know what to do on a
</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Muggle
date,&quot; Neville explained. Or a magical date for that matter. &quot;I
don't even know what Muggle money looks like, how am I gonna... What
should I do, Harry?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Which one?&quot; Hermione's
voice asked cheerfully. The girl was still in the hall, waiting for
Harry to move so she could enter the room.<BR><BR>Neville just handed
the girl the letter he'd received.<BR><BR>&quot;Juliet?&quot;
Hermione said in delight. &quot;They did take my
recommendation.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;This is your fault?&quot; Neville
asked, a look of betrayal adorning the boy's face.<BR><BR>&quot;Move
please, Harry,&quot; Hermione requested, stepping into the room after
he complied. &quot;The selection, yes,&quot; she agreed. &quot;It was
going to happen anyway, and your choices were a shrew, an idiot, and
a sweet but very shy girl. Which would you have chosen?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;The
shy girl,&quot; Neville admitted with a blush.<BR><BR>&quot;Which is
what I suggested,&quot; Hermione said gently. &quot;Most of the
remainder of the letter was to make sure they didn't saddle you with
my cousin Elizabeth, who really is a shrewish bitch.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Hermione,
language,&quot; Harry mock-scolded.<BR><BR>&quot;I also stated that
my cousin Annabel might be acceptable since she really is a very
sweet girl despite the fact that she can't count to five without
using her fingers, and can't count to ten even then,&quot; Hermione
continued, ignoring her best friend. &quot;If I thought I could have
stopped this date from </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >happening,
I'd have asked you if you wanted me to. I'm sorry, Neville, but I
can't do anything about your gran and my mum.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;But
what am I going to do?&quot; Neville demanded, sounding panicked. &quot;I
don't even take muggle studies anymore. I quit before even taking a
term of it.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Which is a good thing since the class
is worse than useless,&quot; Hermione sniffed. &quot;Don't worry,
Neville: Harry will take you out and give you a crash course on how
the Muggle world works.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;I will?&quot; Harry asked,
looking amused.<BR><BR>&quot;It'd be too embarrassing to do it
myself, and I don't know any other Muggle-born that I both know well
enough and trust, to do it,&quot; Hermione agreed, batting her
eyelids. &quot;Please, Harry?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;We can get
permission to go out from McGonagall tomorrow if you want, Neville,&quot;
Harry stated.<BR><BR>&quot;Do you have time for it, Harry?&quot;
Neville asked.<BR><BR>&quot;The professors are all busy writing up
the results of our research,&quot; Harry said with a grin. &quot;Getting
ready for another award dinner in Professor Flitwick's case. It's not
gonna last, but I'm relatively free at the moment.&quot;<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>Harry
woke up the next morning to find that Hermione had forced Neville to
change three times before she was even remotely satisfied with what
he was wearing.<BR><BR>&quot;Pink pants, a bright orange shirt, and a
lime green frock coat,&quot; she muttered in disgust. &quot;Don't get
me started on his shoes. I know he's not color-blind. I just don't
understand it.&quot; It was as though pure-bloods lost what little
common sense they had when someone said the word `Muggle.'<BR><BR>&quot;Weren't
you and Luna planning to do something with your engine today?&quot;
Harry asked, assuming they were always up to something and hoping to
distract the girl.<BR><BR>&quot;What time is it?&quot; Hermione
reached into Harry's pocket and pulled out his watch. &quot;I'm
late!&quot; she squeaked. &quot;I gotta go. I already talked to
Professor McGonagall for you, Harry. You're using the Floo in her
office to go to my London house; my Uncle will be there to meet you.&quot;
She called the last bit over her shoulder as she darted through the
portrait hole.<BR><BR>&quot;Ready to go, Harry?&quot; Neville asked,
causing the other boy to jump.<BR><BR>&quot;How long have you been
there?&quot; Harry blurted, having no idea that someone had managed
to sneak up on him.<BR><BR>&quot;Since Hermione started talking about
color-blindness,&quot; Neville replied. &quot;Shall we go?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;I
suppose we can eat while we're out,&quot; Harry said, tucking his
watch back into his pocket.<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

took the Floo in McGonagall's office and arrived in the London
townhouse that Hermione had grown up in.<BR><BR>&quot;Welcome to the
second house, Mr Harry,&quot; one of the Granger maids greeted them
upon their arrival. &quot;Mrs Granger is waiting for you in the
dining room. Do you know where that is?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;This is my
first time in this house,&quot; Harry replied.<BR><BR>&quot;This
way,&quot; the maid said, leading them down the hall.<BR><BR>&quot;This
house?&quot; Neville muttered.<BR><BR>&quot;According to Hermione,
this is her house for the week. The castle they own is just the
weekend house, so it doesn't count.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Oh,&quot;
Neville replied. &quot;I think we've got a house in London too, but
Gran never uses it. Says it'll be mine when I get out of Hogwarts and
want some space to myself.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Does it have a
greenhouse?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Merlin!&quot; Neville gasped. &quot;It
has to... doesn't it?&quot;<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Might
be something you want to check on, Neville,&quot; Harry stated. &quot;Even
if it does have one already, </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >what
are the chances of it having one that meets your standards?&quot;<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Good
point, Harry. Thanks.&quot; The boy's eyes unfocused as he started
making a mental list of what he </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >would
need.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;No
problem, Neville.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Uh, Harry?&quot; A sudden
thought caused him to snap back to his current predicament.<BR><BR>&quot;Yeah,
Neville?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;What exactly does one do on a date?&quot;
the boy asked. &quot;I've never been on one before.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Not
sure myself, Neville,&quot; Harry confessed. &quot;I've only gone on
one official date myself and it was a bloody
disaster.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Oh.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Don't worry.
Remember how Hermione said her uncle would be here?&quot;<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Yeah?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;He's
here to help us,&quot; Harry said.<BR><BR>&quot;Oh. Great.&quot; They
walked into the dining room to find Hermione's mother seated at the
table. &quot;Thank </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >you
for having me, Mrs Granger,&quot; Neville said formally, snapping off
a quick bow.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Though
distant, we are family, Neville,&quot; Anne stated with a smile. &quot;You
are welcome in our home and may call me by my given name.&quot;<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Okay,&quot;
Neville agreed, blushing in pleasure.<BR><BR>&quot;Did you manage to
get something to eat, or did my daughter chase you away before you
could get to that part?&quot; Hermione's mother asked with a raised
eyebrow.<BR><BR>&quot;Didn't get a chance to eat at Hogwarts; managed
to distract Hermione before she could chase us away,&quot; Harry
replied cheerfully.<BR><BR>The woman nodded to one of the servants.
&quot;Breakfast will be here shortly. My brother will be here in an
hour or two if we're lucky, after noon if we aren't.&quot; It all
depended on how hungover the man was and how quickly he could
disengage himself from the tart of the night.<BR><BR>&quot;Thank
you,&quot; Harry replied.<BR><BR>&quot;No, Harry, thank you for
agreeing to show Neville around the normal world for us,&quot; she
replied. &quot;And thank you, Neville, for agreeing to go on a date
with my niece.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Um... right,&quot; Neville said. He
hadn't been aware he'd had a choice.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Suppose
the first thing to learn is money,&quot; Harry said. The boy pulled a
handful of change and a couple of notes out of his pocket. &quot;As
you can see, the value is printed on each one.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;What's
this one worth?&quot; Neville asked, pointing to one of the
coins.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Five
pence,&quot; Harry replied.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;How
can you tell?&quot;<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;It
has five pence written on it -- see?&quot; Harry pointed out the
number and word.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;What
about this one?&quot; He pointed to another coin.<BR><BR>&quot;One
pound,&quot; Harry said, pointing to the writing.<BR><BR>&quot;What
comes after pound?&quot; Neville asked hesitantly.<BR><BR>&quot;Nothing.
Just two things to remember -- pence and pounds,&quot; Harry replied.
&quot;One hundred pence to one pound.&quot; <BR><BR>The pure-blood
sighed in relief. &quot;That sounds straight-forward enough.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;It
can get more complex than that, but we'll save that for later,&quot;
Harry stated, thanking all that was holy that they'd been born after
Decimal Day.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;If
it helps, all the paper is pounds,&quot; Anne added
helpfully.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Thanks,&quot;
Neville said. &quot;I think I understand.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Which
reminds me,&quot; Harry said. The boy pulled a roll of bills out of
his pocket. &quot;Just in case you don't get a chance to go to
Gringotts.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Thanks, Harry. I'll pay you back as
soon as I can,&quot; Neville said.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Whenever
it's convenient,&quot; Harry said with a shrug. &quot;We're friends,

something for me?&quot; the little blonde asked, not taking her eyes
off the book.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Sure,

the man continued.<BR><BR>&quot;Thanks for agreeing to help, Jim,&quot;
Harry said.<BR><BR>&quot;Always happy to,&quot; Hermione's uncle said
with a grin. &quot;Particularly when I know what I'm helping
with.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Neville's got a date with one of Hermione's
cousins, and I was hoping you'd be willing to give him some pointers
on how to behave,&quot; Harry explained.<BR><BR>The man eyed the
short, slightly pudgy boy standing next to his niece's paramour.
&quot;Which one?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Juliet.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;One of
the few I can stand,&quot; the man said honestly. &quot;Hurt her and
I'll hurt you -- understand?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Yes,&quot; Neville
gulped.<BR><BR>&quot;Good. Now that the threats are out of the way,
we can get down to business.&quot; A wide grin split the man's face.
&quot;How likely are you to have to deal with an assassination
attempt while you're out?&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Less than Harry, but
more than the average bloke,&quot; Neville replied, starting to feel
at ease, as Hermione's uncle reminded him a bit of some of the Aurors
that used to drop by to check on him when he was younger.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Right,&quot;
Jim agreed, making a mental note to request that extra security be
present when the lad was out with his niece. &quot;We'll worry about
it later. First, I think, we'll visit my tailor.&quot;<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Um,
can we stop at Gringotts first to convert some of my Galleons?&quot;
Neville asked.<BR><BR>&quot;My treat.&quot; The big man's smile
deepened. &quot;Actually, I've got a better idea. Let me ask you a
few questions about pure-blood society and I'll charge everything to
my employer as a business expense.&quot;<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Harry?&quot;
Neville looked over at the other boy.<BR><BR>&quot;If it helps, his
boss is friends with Madam Bones and knows about magic,&quot; Harry
stated. &quot;Up to you, Neville.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;So long as you
don't want me to violate the Statute,&quot; Neville said slowly. &quot;But
are you sure? I really can pay if I can go to the bank first.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;How
'bout this? I'll treat you to a tour of my world, and you do the same
for me in your world at a later date?&quot; Jim offered, eager to get
a chance to pick the boy's brain.<BR><BR>&quot;Okay,&quot; Neville
agreed. &quot;But only if I can get you a new set of robes when you
do.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Deal,&quot; Jim laughed, sticking his hand
out.<BR><BR>&quot;Am I supposed to spit on it before we shake?&quot;
Neville asked, having a vague memory about Muggle </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >handshake
etiquette.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;No,&quot;
Jim replied. &quot;People do it, but they don't tend to do it often
these days, and almost never when </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >they
come from our social class.&quot;<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Right.&quot;
Neville shook the large man's hand.<BR><BR>&quot;Coming, Harry?&quot;
Jim asked. &quot;Before you answer, you should remember that my
brother-in-law will never forgive you if he finds out you had a
chance to screw Charlie out of a few pounds and didn't take
it.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Sure,&quot; Harry agreed.<BR><BR>&quot;Finished
eating?&quot; the big man asked, upon receiving affirmative nods, he
continued. &quot;We'll take my brother in law's car for three good
reasons,&quot; Jim announced. &quot;The first is that it will annoy
him to discover that I took the opportunity to steal every drop of
good booze he had in it. The second is because it's large enough for
the three of us, which my Aston is not. The third is that you won't
accidentally activate the ejection seat or the hidden machine guns if
you hit the wrong button by mistake.&quot; The two boys laughed in
appreciation of the Joke. Jim snapped his fingers, summoning one of
the servants. &quot;Get a driver for whatever my brother in law's
newest, biggest, toy is and bring it </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >around

a few minutes, they were on the road and Jim was exploring the liquor

adorning his face. &quot;That bloody bastard!&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;What's
wrong?&quot; Harry asked.<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;My
no good brother in law took out all the good stuff and replaced
everything alcoholic with the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >garbage
the government uses to strip the paint off old navy ships,&quot; Jim
replied. &quot;I'm not sure this is something I can forgive. There
are jokes and there's depriving a man of the finer things in life.&quot;
The big man pulled three bottles of soda out of the fridge and handed
one to each boy. &quot;Still, they say sacrifice is good for the
soul.&quot;<BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Where
are we going first?&quot; Harry prompted.<BR><BR>&quot;Savile Row to
meet with my tailor,&quot; Jim replied. &quot;Haberdasher or barber

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>Jim
spent much of the ride skillfully and subtly extracting every bit of
information about wizarding society and government from Neville. It
was a novel change, being on the collection side rather than the user
side for once -- not one he thought he'd enjoy making permanent, of
course, but certainly worth doing again at some future point.<BR><BR>He
seamlessly switched to a more mundane subject the instant they
stepped out of the car.<BR><BR>&quot;Juliet is very shy and very
intelligent,&quot; Jim said as they walked into the tailor's shop. He
glanced at the proprietor. &quot;Put a rush on this one. We'll come
back in an hour for the first fitting, and an hour after that for the
second.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; the tailor agreed.<BR><BR>The
boy's did their best to imitate Jim's easy manner as they endured
being measured. &quot;Her current obsession seems to be natural
science; botany, biology, that sort of thing.&quot;<BR><BR>Hermione's
uncle switched from dispensing advice to asking questions and back as
they hit his favorite barber shop, haberdasher, and club for a meal.
All interspersed by return visits to the tailor for more
fittings.<BR><BR>As they returned to the Granger family's townhouse
later that evening, Jim couldn't resist dispensing a few last bits of
advice to ensure that his niece's date with the shy magic-user would
be interesting, if not enjoyable.<BR><BR>&quot;If nothing else,
remember to make a witty remark after you dispose of an assassin,&quot;
Jim continued. &quot;For example; if you throw one into the back of a
garbage truck to be compacted, you might say something along the
lines of `What a crushing bore.' Or if it was an industrial shredder,
one might say something like `Oh my, he's gone all to pieces.' I find
it helps to think up as many situations and remarks as possible
beforehand.&quot;<BR><BR>Neville turned his laughter into a cough as
the man trailed off. &quot;I'll try to remember that.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;I'm
completely serious,&quot; Jim stated. &quot;It does help to think up
situations and remarks ahead of time. Just remember that you can't
think of everything and don't worry about it too much. The act of
thinking and practicing ahead of time will make it easier to think up
things on the fly.&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;Okay,&quot; Neville
agreed.<BR><BR>&quot;It's likely my sister will provide the car and
give the driver a schedule for you to follow. It's not good for her
to get used to having her plans work out, so I'm going to give you a
list of acceptable places. Chose one of them and have the driver take
you there.&quot;<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The information was both
troubling and too stale to do anything about.<BR><BR>&quot;I want

Lucius wanted to scream in frustration, how could something so big
have come out of nowhere? His son was supposed to have warned him
about the bloody girl's family! Keeping an eye out for things like
that was one of the reasons the little bastard was in Hogwarts in the

to get more information on what Bones is doing.&quot;<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;All

for a week or two.<BR><BR>&quot;Minerva said you were a good boy,&quot;
Vector said with her first smile of the conversation. &quot;The lead
researcher on the other hand said that you were, at best, an idiot

propensity for creating strange effects.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I,
on the other hand, believe that you have at least some clue as to the

down. “I melded three charms together with a fourth that I came up

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >And
your lever trick still changes everything,” Hermione continued, “we
didn't consider it because no one's ever figured out a way to get it
to work.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Though
we must admit that we should have seen that it was far more likely
than our original conclusion,” Luna admitted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Especially
considering your idea about solidifying air to have a flying train,&quot;
Harry pointed out. &quot;What do you think gave me the idea?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Our
enchantments are going to take months to cast and the amount of
magical energy that we're going to need to draw on is enormous,”
Hermione said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;There
is also no way we'd be able to power it without leeching a good deal
of magic from the environment,&quot; Luna agreed. &quot;We'd have
still been excited if you'd have taken months to lift the
train-&quot;<BR><BR>&quot;-because it still would have been an
impressive feat of magic,&quot; Hermione agreed. &quot;But pulling
out your wand and lifting it?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fine,
I get it,” Harry agreed. “Just don't let slip what I told you to
the people working on trying to figure out how I did it.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Why
not?” Hermione asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Well,
you know how a bunch of them came in and took the project away from
Professor Vector?” Harry asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
did?” Luna asked, clearly outraged by the lack of professional
courtesy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Said
that she'd done well to bring the matter to their attention but that
the services of a school teacher were not needed,” Harry continued,
“she was less than pleased when found me and told me what
happened.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >And
you told her how you did it?” Luna asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >After
she asked me to help her figure it out, I told her I already knew.
She's been busy writing a paper on it for submission,” Harry
agreed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
you want us to let the prats struggle because they were rude to
Professor Vector?” Hermione giggled. “Harry, you gentleman.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That
and she told me that they were producing some interesting theories
and that it would be a shame if someone told them that their whole
premise was based on a mistake,” Harry admitted. “Professor
Vector figures that either they waste a bunch of time or they come up
with a theory that changes the nature of reality. In other words, she
gets her revenge or she's so excited by the new theory that she
doesn't care.” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I
. . . ah, thank you, Harry,&quot; Hermione said. &quot;We were at the
engine shed earlier speaking with the crew and it came out that the
current owners of the Hogwarts Express are looking to sell.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;You'd
like to buy it,&quot; Harry guessed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Yes,&quot;
Hermione admitted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Do
you have enough?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;More
than enough in the Gringotts account that daddy set up for me to use
this year,&quot; Hermione agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;So
what do you need?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Could
you look at some business papers for me?” Hermione asked. “Luna
and I ran the numbers, but this can't be right.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
can't be right?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Look how cheaply we can buy the
Hogwarts Express,&quot; Hermione said. &quot;It's below scrap value
if our numbers are correct.&quot; 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >This
isn't just the Hogwarts Express, it's several trains, the engine
shed, the tracks, and everything else.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Yes,”
Hermione agreed. “Why is it so inexpensive?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
saw it yourself,” Harry said, pointing to a column of numbers. “The
current owners are losing money on maintenance, even with the fact
that the Ministry pays half the upkeep on the tracks. They can't
raise prices or cancel service due to their contract with Hogwarts.
Owning the train means they're locked into the contract to supply
transport to Hogwarts which in turn means they lose money every
year.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
if someone just wanted to buy it so they could play with the trains?”
Hermione asked innocently. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'd
suggest they buy it and then start hauling freight to and from
Hogsmead,” Harry replied. “I'd guess that would at least offset
some of the losses and might even bring a profit.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;So
you think this might be a good investment?&quot; Hermione asked
intently, knowing he'd just given her a lever that would allow her to
convince her father to give her more funding for her projects. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;It
might be,&quot; he agreed. &quot;Would have to study the issue to be
sure either way.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Thank

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;The
Granger Heiress has purchased the company responsible for running the
Hogwarts Express,&quot; Hooktooth reported. &quot;Along with the

planned to begin hauling cargo to Hogsmead and a couple other small
settlements on the same line.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;That
as things are, she's in a position to significantly undercut her

profit margins will increase dramatically once her coal mine reaches
full production.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Interesting.
Do we know what role if any the last Potter played in this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Sources
indicate the Granger Heiress approached the Potter for advice and
approval before making the purchase. Our analysts believe that he's
been asked by her father to act as the Granger Heiress's advisor or
arbiter during her test of worthiness.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I've
had a report that the Lovegood's daughter has formed a close
relationship to the Granger Heiress,&quot; the senior goblin stated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Our
analysts are split on that one,&quot; Hooktooth admitted. &quot;Half
of them believe that the Granger Heiress is cultivating her to be the
Potter's junior wife.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT ><BR>&quot;Humans
do not work like that,&quot; the senior goblin growled. &quot;Everyone
who's ever spent time as a teller knows that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;We're
no longer sure that's absolutely true,&quot; Hooktooth said
nervously. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Explain!&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;You
are aware of the Granger Heiress's fondness for books?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I
am.&quot; The senior goblin had a look of impatience on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;We
have managed to acquire a record of her purchases for the last six
months. Unsurprisingly, the majority seem to be related to her school
courses and business ventures, but, along with those were a small
percentage of novels filled with examples of romantic interpersonal
relationships between humans.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;So?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;So
the intelligence department purchased a representative sample of
those books and it seems that a number of them were about females of
lesser social status engaged in sexual relationships with attached
males of higher social status.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;The
Granger family is of a much higher social status than the Lovegoods,&quot;
the senior goblin said in understanding. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;As
is the Potter family if you take the into account the fame accorded
to the last Potter for his part in his parents defeat of their last
dark lord,&quot; Hooktooth said cautiously. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;True.
Do we have any more evidence to support that conclusion?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Observers
report that the Granger Heiress seems not to mind the idea of the
Lovegood forming a relationship with the last Potter,&quot; Hooktooth
agreed. &quot;The intelligence department approached a number of
human employees with strong ties to the non-magical world and several
of them stated that they believed such relationships to be common
among high caste non-magical humans.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Increase
the intelligence department's budget by fifteen percent to research
the mating habits of high status non-magical humans,&quot; the senior
goblin said after a moment of thought. &quot;What do the analysts
think of our plan to dispatch a token amount of aid to the Granger
heiress?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;They
believe that it will help solidify our relationship with the Granger
family and they do not believe it will annoy her father,&quot;
Hooktooth replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Why?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Mostly
based on the last Potter's behavior and on statements made by the
Head of the Granger family. It is believed that the Head will view
this as a show of support and approval by Gringotts to his chosen
successor.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >With
Luna trailing behind, Hermione stepped out of the building to regard
her visitor. It was a young goblin, she guessed, based on the lack of
wrinkles and scars that she'd seen on most of the other members of
his race she'd come into contact with. He was dressed in a clean set
of dark blue overalls with a brown leather tool belt and a white
canvas tool bag clutched in his left hand.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Steam

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;All
right,&quot; Hermione said slowly, trying to remember what her father
had told her about interviews. &quot;Why did you decide to leave
Gringotts?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I
figured promotions would come faster in a start up,&quot; the goblin
explained. &quot;I've got another year before I can be promoted to
fourth class and six after that before I can even be considered for
third.&quot; Not to mention the fact that the goblin that had
'suggested' he apply may have mentioned that he could always come
back to his old job, that any seniority with the Granger girl would
be considered the same as working for Gringotts, and that promotions
at Gringotts might come a bit faster after acquiring a bit of
experience at the Granger's new company. That's if he ever decided to
leave — he had a feeling that getting in on the ground floor, and
staying in once he got in, would be a very good idea. </FONT></FONT>

well protected or too closely watched by people who are too well

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I
agree with Tracy that it's not worth the risk to us to find out,&quot;
Daphne added. &quot;At least, not at the moment. I just think that
you or uncle might be worth looking into because it might give us a
way to turn him against his family in the future and destroy the rest
of the whole filthy lot of them. Better for the world if they're not

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Who's
number one on the list of students we don't want to annoy,&quot;
Tracy said as she put up privacy charms. &quot;Reliable rumor
suggests that he's killed at least two professors and has faced the
Dark Lord in single combat on more than one occasion. Based on a
quick peek we were able to get at his medical records, we know that
he rescued the Weasley daughter from a basilisk of truly epic
proportions if the size of his scars and the amount of venom in his
blood is any judge.&quot;  </FONT></FONT>

that to the fact that he's got a large number of ex-aurors on his pay

Oddly enough, there was one corner of the room that sat untouched. </FONT></FONT>

pristine part of the room. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Yes,

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Get
the other female prefects and have them help Madame Pomfrey move
these girls to the hospital wing,&quot; he ordered. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Yes,
Professor,&quot; the prefect agreed. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Poppy,
I would take it as a personal favor if you would keep them till after
I had a chance to speak with them tomorrow,&quot; he continued. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;No
problem, Filius,&quot; the school nurse agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Flitwick
was gratified when his missing student returned to her dorm with two
minutes to spare. &quot;Good evening, Ms. Lovegood.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Good
evening, Professor,&quot; the girl stated politely. &quot;What
happened?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Your
roommates tripped one of the antitheft charms you had protecting your
possessions,&quot; he replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Luna
looked at her section of the room and her heart momentarily stopped
when she noticed something missing, restarting a second later when
she saw her picture frame laying on the floor and apparently
undamaged. Two steps brought her to it and she snatched it up,
holding it close to her chest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;May
I see it?&quot; Filius asked gently. &quot;I promise that I'll be
careful with it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Yes,
Professor,&quot; Luna agreed. With obvious reluctance, the girl
handed it over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Flitwick
was relieved to see that the picture frame did not appear to be
damaged. As he inspected it, it began cycling through a number of
different photos. The first was a picture of the girl's mother, the
second was of her father, the third was Luna standing next to
Hermione Granger, the fourth was Harry Potter in a great kilt, the
fifth was of Harry Potter in a set of formal muggle clothing, the
sixth was a picture of her parents together. He handed it back before
it got to the seventh. &quot;I'm glad to see that it wasn't damaged.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;So
am I, Professor,&quot; the girl said softly. &quot;Am I going to be
in trouble for this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;You
have a right to protect what is yours,&quot; he assured the girl.
&quot;Have they tried to take your things before?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;They've
succeeded, Professor,&quot; the girl admitted. &quot;One of my
friends decided that they would not succeed again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Give
Ms. Granger my compliments and tell her that I would be happy to lend
her a couple books on the subject from my personal library if she
would like,&quot; Flitwick offered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Thank
you, Professor, I will and I believe she would.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Be
sure to tell me if this sort of thing happens again,&quot; Flitwick
ordered. He rather doubted it would, not after what happened and what
he was planning to do about it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Yes,
Professor, I will,&quot; Luna agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Good.
Have a pleasant night, Ms. Lovegood.&quot; Filius walked down to the
common room and stopped the first male student he could find. &quot;Go
up to the dorms and tell the first prefect you find that I want to
see them in my office right bloody now,&quot; he ordered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Yes,
Professor,&quot; the boy squeaked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Flitwick's
seventh year male prefect arrived at his office only a few minutes
after he himself did. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;You
called for me, Professor?&quot; the boy asked nervously. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Were
you aware that Ms. Lovegood's roommates were tormenting her and
stealing her things?” the diminutive charms professor asked mildly.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Knew
that they were picking on her,” the Prefect answered, “did not
know they were stealing from her.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Is
there some reason you did nothing about it?” Flitwick demanded
hotly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Told
one of the female Prefects to look into it, Professor,” the boy
answered quickly, “I'd have handled it myself but I can't get into
the dorm to do my own investigation.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
see.” He stared at the boy for a few moments. “Were you aware
that Ms. Lovegood is in young Mr. Potter's circle of friends? One
apparently close enough for him to have Ms. Granger to place
anti-theft charms on her things?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
was not, Professor,” the suddenly pale Prefect choked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Were
you aware that Ms. Lovegood and Mr. Potter spent the holiday at Ms.
Granger's house?” Flitwick asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
was not aware of that either, Professor,” the prefect replied
sickly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Were
you aware that Mr. Potter considers Ms. Lovegood to be one of his
very good friends and are you aware of what happens to those that go
against Mr. Potter?” Filius cracked a smile. “If you are not, I
have some pictures I could show you provided you've skipped dinner
tonight. Best to hold off if you haven't. I have no desire to replace
my carpet, you never seem to get the smell of vomit out no matter how
skilled at charms you are.”  Speculation among the staff was that
Snape survived because Harry figured no hell could be worse than
being a Snape.  Others figured it was because Snape was at least
intelligent enough to leave Harry's friends out of his vendetta
against the boy's father. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I've
heard what happens, Professor,” the prefect said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Speculate
for me, what do you think will happen when you inform the
investigating female prefect of what you just learned?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
think she'll step up her investigation,” he replied quickly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >No
need, please inform her and the other Prefects that I've already
dealt with the matter personally.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
will, Professor.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >While
you're at it, let them know that I do not like having to deal with
these matters personally since that's what I'm supposed to have
Prefects for.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
will, Professor.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Since
I'm doing the work of my Prefects, it seems to me that I have no need
of them at all,” the Professor continued, “it's something I'm
going to have to think about over the coming weeks. I suggest that
you all demonstrate how useful you are.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
will, Professor.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Tell
me, do you happen to know if there's any rule that prevents me from
appointing Prefects from the ranks of another house?” Filius
continued. “It occurs to me that Mr. Potter's robes could use some
adornment.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
don't know, Professor, but I can find out for you if you like,

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Splendid
idea. While you're at it, find out if it's possible to be a prefect

at our next meeting,&quot; Filius finished.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>

talked about.” </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Daphne
and Tracy woke up early the next morning to discuss strategy. The
most important thing, they decided, was to be calm and polite.
Everything they knew about the girl suggested that she'd be
reasonable so long as they gave no reason for her to become
unreasonable. Much better than the usual sorts in magical business. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
two girls left Slytherin long before most of their housemates had
awoken and spent nearly two hours staking out the area where their
target met her friend from Ravenclaw every morning.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;There
they are,&quot; Tracy whispered. Both girls stepped into the middle
of the hallway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Granger,
Lovegood,” Daphne said tightly, trying to will her pulse to slow.
The fact that the next few minutes could prove to be vital to their
family's future did not help matters.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Greengrass,
Davis,” Hermione replied. “What do you want?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >To
talk,” Daphne replied. She held up her hands when the other two
girls gave them looks of disbelief. “Really.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >When
have we done anything to antagonize you or Potter?” Tracy added. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;All
right,&quot; Hermione agreed. &quot;Talk.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Don't
you think we should have our discussion some place a bit more
private?” Tracy asked with a smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Come
on,&quot; Luna said suddenly. &quot;Harry showed me how to get into
the kitchens — it's private enough if you don't mind the house
elves.&quot; And it would make her feel a lot more comfortable if
they had Dobby backing them up in case something went wrong.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >After
you then,” Daphne agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Both
Slytherins noted with approval the fact that while Lovegood took the
lead, Granger trailed behind.  They'd have been somewhat worried if
the other girls were willing to show any hint of vulnerability at
this stage as it'd have shown a frightening amount of confidence or
complacency. Neither of which would inspire confidence. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What's
this all about?” Hermione demanded after they'd reached the
kitchens and taken their seats around a large round table. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Your new freight business looks
to compete with our families’ existing freight business and our
muggle world imports,&quot; Tracy replied. 'Worse, according to their
accountants, it looked as if the muggle born would win any direct
conflict and drive them out of the market,' Tracy thought unhappily.
The war chest the other girl had to fall back on was nothing short of
awe inspiring.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Daphne
sighed. “Which is why we've come on behalf of our families to
negotiate with you.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What
are you offering?” Hermione asked, hiding her confusion at just
what the other two girls were talking about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We've
got existing contracts and extensive contacts,” Tracy said calmly.
“You've got trains and know how. We put those together and we've
got a smooth and profitable transition.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >There's
enough profit for all of us and I don't think anyone wants a trade
war,” Daphne added, a touch hopefully. “You might win, or you
might not. Either way, it would cost you money.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
not too concerned with profit,” Hermione admitted. “It's nice to
have, but not something I'm dependent on.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
this is all to run our families into the ground?” Daphne said with
a slight waver in her voice, she did not like the direction this
conversation was heading. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
have no intention of doing that,” Hermione said to the immense
relief of the other two girls. “Have your families send me your
offer, I'll show it to Harry and my father. We can go from there.
Deal?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Deal,”
Daphne said with a grin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Deal,”
Tracy echoed, ruthlessly suppressing the urge to break out into happy
historical giggles. Looked like their families wouldn't be driven
into poverty after all. Might even be able get into a better position
than they were before. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Did

this,&quot; Phil said honestly. &quot;Flint said that Harry's idea is
a good one providing we wish to subjugate the other two families and
leverage ourselves into pureblood society once Hermione becomes head
of the family. She added that there are better stepping stones if
that is our intention.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

one's options open.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;And
that's what had you so distracted?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;What
was in the note?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Our

and requests that I send along any plans if the answer is yes.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

times over,&quot; Phil replied with a grin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;So
you were distracted by the thought of all the cars you were going to
have to add to your collection and the fact that you can probably get
our daughter to maintain them for you,&quot; Anne asked with a raised
eyebrow. &quot;The thought that our daughter might do an honest day's
work in her life, especially in, gasp, one of the trades.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Console
yourself with the thought of your great uncle's wildly impractical
garden and all the work in it that he insisted on doing himself.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;The
difference there is that his hobby cost the family quite a bit of
money, whereas our daughter's threatens to make it. The shame, the
scandal that one of my blood could do such a thing.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Just
goes to show that your step mother was correct when she said my blood
would dilute yours.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Perish
the thought that, that harpy would be correct about anything.&quot;
Anne giggled. &quot;Nothing for it but to give Hermione more pocket
money and with instructions that she wastes it on something
frivolous.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

Something similar would have never occurred at Gringotts, no higher

different, Sprocket reminded himself. </FONT></FONT>

took that as a hopeful sign. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Thing
is, we don't need anymore men in the regular crews and bringing in

<P><BR>
</P>

would be responsible for the maintenance of the employer's personal

wasn't misunderstanding. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;And
to whatever other projects the girls decided to work on,&quot; the
foreman agreed. &quot;Quickly as things have been moving, I wouldn't
be surprised to see you with your own crew and a dozen more engines
to take care of afore the year is out. Don't hesitate to sing out if
you need a hand or twelve till that happens.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I
will not permit pride to sabotage the chance you have given me,
foreman, you have my word on that,&quot; Sprocket said seriously. To
be given responsibility for a piece of equipment was enough to have
made him deliriously happy, but to be given charge of the chief's
personal engine? Sprocket would cut his throat rather than live to
face the shame of failure. </FONT></FONT>

was overcome by a sense of nostalgia as she walked through the gates
of her alma mater for the first time in over a decade. The faces may
have changed but everything else was just as she remembered it. The
sights, the sounds, the sense of tension every time one group got too
close to another consisting of a rival house. Far as she was
concerned the only things good about the rotten place was the fact
that it had given her an excuse to spend the majority of the year
away from her family and the fact that it had been where she'd met
her husband. Everything else could go hang. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Phil's
not going to go with your suggestion and I'm here to explain why,
and, with your permission to keep myself available to assist you with
similar issues in the future,&quot; Flint replied. She was there on
Tonks' orders who had given them at the strong suggestion of the
Chief of Magical Law Enforcement who had also strongly suggested that
her new boss might need someone to help him with pureblood issues and
general administration. From housewife to aide to the most powerful
wizard in the country. She was going up in the world Flint reflected
to herself. </FONT></FONT>

Harry prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Your
idea would be great if what you wanted to do was to force the
Greengrass and Davis families to submit to the Granger family, which
is a fairly standard way of leveraging a new-blood family into
pureblood society. Problem with it is that you didn't take the people
involved into account, see, thing is that the heads of both families
are mean bastards in a fight. They'd smile and go along with it while
measuring your back for a dagger.&quot; Metaphorical, literal or
both. Whichever they thought they could get away with. &quot;On the
other hand, they also have the reputation for dealing fair.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Alright,&quot;
Harry agreed. &quot;Why would . . .&quot; he trailed off as his sleep

here to explain things in person?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Some

It's a great honor to be given the chance of becoming a crafter of
new devices, one I've always aspired to but never thought I'd receive
for at least several decades.&quot;  Upon seeing the girls'
confusion, he decided to elaborate. &quot;Had I remained with
Gringotts, it was likely that I'd spend at least twenty more years as
a technician before I had an opportunity to become a foreman and
another several decades after that before I could become a junior
craftsman.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;An
item made by a goblin master craftsman belongs to the clan. We
believe that once a goblin artisan has reached their peak, they stop
acting as an individual and become a living treasure of the goblin

marvel at them and use them as inspiration to achieve even greater

in several shades of lip marks every time he visits the team, he's
been seen on more than one occasion with more than one of them on his

to maintain it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

Dobby's glare deepened, sizing up his potential opponent. A quick pop
back to create distance, a hand wave to bombard the goblin with
everything he could touch with his magic, followed by another pop to
close. A bit of quick work with a kitchen knife and bob's your uncle.
Solid bits to Hogwarts' pigs and the drain for everything else.
Though . . . hadn't Harry Potter sir's Loveygood said something about
goblins making good pies? Perhaps the pigs would have to do without.

better access to its human prey . . . which seemed to be contradicted
by its protective interest in the Potter. She gave a mental sigh, why
couldn't she have gone into a simple field like dragon husbandry?

Gringotts would do well to make allies of Clan Granger for she had no

you about it ahead of time. I almost didn't,” the goblin snorted.
“Hell, she almost didn't when she heard it.” And likely wouldn't

goblin turned to his subordinate. “Find out everything else you can

Tonks tomorrow, who serves as the local head of security and with Ms.

detail since she's had a security detail.” His lips pursed.
“Hermione tends not to acknowledge the fact that she even has a
security detail, but will listen if told she cannot do something for
her own safety. Just be sure to stress that it is important.” </FONT></FONT>

will be taking possession of a foundry, a forge, and a small factory.
We will be responsible for their maintenance and will be able to use
them but they, along with the coal mine, will be spun off into a
separate entity under my direct control. Expect that more facilities
will be added later. We will also be taking possession of an engine
repair facility, a ship yard, three scrap yards, no less than a dozen
engines with funding to put them in working order, and several
hectares of land.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Mistress.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The new facilities under my direct
control are not required or even expected to make any money. We may
use them for our projects, or we may let them lay fallow. We need to
get them in a working state quickly and we need not spare any expense
getting them there.”  Hermione sighed. “I'm afraid we will have
to be a bit slower and more mindful of costs for everything else. Do
you understand, Sprocket?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I understand your orders, Mistress,”
the goblin said carefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why are you taking possession of
several properties that may be drains on your finances, Mistress?”
Anguish asked, looking up from the contract she'd been examining. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They're tax write offs for the
family,” Hermione explained. “Taking a small loss on them means
we pay less on taxes from other income. Managing them is another of
daddy's tricks to make me spend more time on business and less time
having fun. He knew I couldn't resist making them mine,” the girl
sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“As you say, Mistress,” Anguish
stated. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll show you the relevant parts of
the law later,” Hermione promised. “Sprocket, could you let the
new workers know that we're going to start doing the initial surveys
of the new properties tomorrow? I'll be in to meet them and give them
the details after we finish here.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, Mistress!” the goblin
spun on his heels and marched back to the group. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I believe that I have found
something, Mistress,” Anguish reported. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How bad is it?” Hermione braced
herself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It states that you agree to wear
clothing deemed appropriate by your mother every time you open a new
facility and that you agree to open any facility that is to be under
your direct control and any company in which at least two percent of
the stock is owned by you personally or by a company under your
direct control. In return you will be personally awarded one percent
of the new company's stock, unless it is already under your direct
control, and in return for acting as your mother's proxy, the Potter
will be awarded one half of a percent of the company's stock.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I noticed that, Anguish, it's why it
states that Harry gets one half of a percent for acting as mother's
proxy. Daddy's been taking advantage of his good nature to have him
do it for free and I will not have it. I told daddy that I expected
Harry to be compensated for his time and daddy agreed.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Enthusiastically, the man was
tremendously pleased to have a chance to deepen ties with his
daughter's friend. “Daddy and I also have an agreement to make that
clause retroactive which will give Harry a half percent of the coal
mine.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see. I will continue my search,
Mistress.” It didn't take Anguish long to find another potentially
embarrassing clause. “It states here that you agree to restore any
motor vehicles older than nineteen seventy and to offer your father
first refusal at ten percent below market.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?” The girl's eyes narrowed.
“Where?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It is burred rather well, mistress.
This section here states that you will restore any historical
vehicles, this clause here states that the term historic will mean
any vehicle made before the year nineteen seventy and that you will
grant your father the right of first refusal for any sales of
restored vehicles.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where does it give him a discount?”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Near the end when you agree to a ten
percent discount for any member of the family for goods and
services.” 
</P>
<P><BR>

<P>“If you knew, why did you sign,

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Really?&quot;
her charge's blonde shadow asked brightly. &quot;Do you think it
would be possible to look over examples ourselves even if he manages
to get plans for us?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Probably,&quot;
her charge replied. Hermione daintily accepted the envelope,
automatically passing it to her shadow as she continued speaking.
&quot;Please thank daddy for me and please pass on Luna's request
with it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I

Hermione asked with a confused frown. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Harry's
either hiding in an unused classroom somewhere or hanging out with
Ron in Ron's wood shop,&quot; Hermione stated confidently. &quot;Ron's
wood shop is next to the Quidditch equipment room across from Hooch's
office. If Harry isn't there, go to the kitchens and tell Dobby that
you need to find him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>

explained. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ron
didn't bother to look up from his work when the woman entered. Wasn't
anyone in the world important enough to risk making a mistake and

</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Afraid

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;My

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Not

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That
bit of news did cause Ron's hands to still as the boy wrested his
attention away from the project and up to make eye contact. &quot;Who's
the message from and why are you delivering it?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Message
is from Phil Granger, I'm delivering it because I'm one of the Potter

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Phil
Granger?&quot; Ron pushed aside his confusion at the words 'Potter

practice. &quot;Oi, Harry, got someone here to speak with you!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >A
head appeared over a stack of loose wood and two bleary sleep
deprived eyes regarded Flint from under a mop of messy black hair.
&quot;You work for Tonks,&quot; the boy said with a yawn. &quot;What
can I do for you?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Mind

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;What's

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Phil's
not going to go with your suggestion and I'm here to explain why,
and, with your permission to keep myself available to assist you with
similar issues in the future,&quot; Flint replied. She was there on
Tonks' orders who had given them at the strong suggestion of the
Chief of Magical Law Enforcement who had also strongly suggested that
her new boss might need someone to help him with pureblood issues and
general administration. From housewife to aide to the most powerful
wizard in the country. She was going up in the world Flint reflected
to herself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Okay,&quot;
Harry prompted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Your
idea would be great if what you wanted to do was to force the
Greengrass and Davis families to submit to the Granger family, which
is a fairly standard way of leveraging a new-blood family into
pureblood society. Problem with it is that you didn't take the people
involved into account, see, thing is that the heads of both families
are mean bastards in a fight. They'd smile and go along with it while
measuring your back for a dagger.&quot; Metaphorical, literal or
both. Whichever they thought they could get away with. &quot;On the
other hand, they also have the reputation for dealing fair.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Alright,&quot;
Harry agreed. &quot;Why would . . .&quot; he trailed off as his sleep
addled mind made a few connections. &quot;Never mind. Why are you
here to explain things in person?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Some
things are best delivered in person,&quot; Flint said, grin
deepening. &quot;Good example of that is the second half of our
conversation.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione
and Luna somehow managed to keep themselves from tearing oven the
envelope until after they got to the engine shed and a table to lay
out the plans. What followed was two hours of pouring over technical
drawings until both girls jointly decided that they were ready to
construct their first prototype. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sprocket,
who'd been holding himself silently ready, took that as his cue to

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;How

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Okay,

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Make?&quot;
the goblin asked dumbly, sure that there'd been some mistake. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Yeah,&quot;
Hermione agreed. &quot;Daddy sent a few technical drawings for a . .

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Thank

going to make a prototype to see if we understood how it's supposed
to work. Do you have time to help us?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Blood
pounded in his ears as Sprocket's knees buckled. He couldn't believe
what he was hearing, the opportunity he was being given, the chance
to aid in the creation of an entirely new device. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Are
you alright?&quot; he found himself looking into the concerned eyes
of his employer's blonde companion. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I
am,&quot; the goblin said shakily. &quot;Just overcome with emotion.
It's a great honor to be given the chance of becoming a crafter of
new devices, one I've always aspired to but never thought I'd receive
for at least several decades.&quot;  Upon seeing the girls'
confusion, he decided to elaborate. &quot;Had I remained with
Gringotts, it was likely that I'd spend at least twenty more years as
a technician before I had an opportunity to become a foreman and
another several decades after that before I could become a junior
craftsman.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;It's
that difficult?&quot; Hermione asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Honors
so great are seldom easy to achieve,&quot; Sprocket stated. &quot;Even
that would only be a stepping stone to achieving my dream of becoming
a master craftsman, one who's works could never be sold.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;Why
can't a master craftsman sell his things?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;An
item made by a goblin master craftsman belongs to the clan. We
believe that once a goblin artisan has reached their peak, they stop
acting as an individual and become a living treasure of the goblin
race as a whole. Master craftsmen produces objects of such quality
and beauty that they must be preserved so that future generations can
marvel at them and use them as inspiration to achieve even greater
levels.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It's
like the family money,” Hermione exclaimed, eyes lighting in
understanding. “Daddy controls it, but it doesn't belong to any one
person, it belongs to the Granger family as a whole, even-no,
especially the members of it that haven't been born yet.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That
is remarkably similar,” the goblin agreed, surprised at the human.
“I was unaware that there were humans that took such a view.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sprocket
spent the remainder of the day with his employer's latest project,
managing to produce a working model shortly before the sun went down

spent another hour cleaning and ordering the work area before
returning to Gringotts for a matter that could result in his messy
death. </FONT></FONT>

had retired for the day when a messenger informed him that the goblin
he'd 'encouraged' to seek employment with the Granger Heiress had
returned to Gringotts and was demanding an audience. With a sigh, he
signaled for the junior goblin to be shown in. Either it really was
important enough to disturb him or he'd get the pleasure of
destroying someone who should never should have been permitted to
live past adolescence. Both were worth missing a bit of sleep. </FONT></FONT>

the senior goblin prompted in a tone of voice that informed the other
goblin that there had better be more.  </FONT></FONT>

</P>

was hoping you could clarify something for me.&quot; Sprocket licked

would like to know what would happen if I were to share

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;The

of jeopardizing my life or future career prospects.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

considered the matter. &quot;Speak.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

rocked back on his heels, claws twitching in astonishment. &quot;Y-you

&quot;He's welcome in the Harpies locker room, he's come home covered
in several shades of lip marks every time he visits the team, he's
been seen on more than one occasion with more than one of them on his

Harpies. He saved them. They're dating him. &quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

save their relatives and their friend's relatives. But he is the boy

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;There

the inspector bit her tongue, hoping that choking off the question

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I

work. I'll be happy to report to my superiors that you've created the
first completely magical horseless carriage in the country. Don't be

or replacing the current Ministry cars with one of yours.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;We

“Exquisite. Easily the best I've had the pleasure of experiencing.”</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
am eternally grateful that you pressed me to take more back to the

make trade agreements,” he finished somewhat wistfully. Or perhaps
not, there was little chance that he would be able to bargain
effectively after his first bite. </FONT></FONT>

stared in awe at the corpse of the great serpent. To think that a
human child could slay such a beast in single combat. She shook her
head in wonder, it was an amazing task even with the aid he had from
the firebird. More than anything else, it drove home the fact that
Gringotts would do well to make allies of Clan Granger for she had no
doubt that they'd be terrifying opponents with such a warrior on
their side. </FONT></FONT>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >She
suggests that it would be best to go without any foreknowledge.”
The goblin thought for a moment before deciding to add a bit more
information. “It's possible you wouldn't believe her if she told
you about it ahead of time. I almost didn't,” the goblin snorted.
“Hell, she almost didn't when she heard it.” And likely wouldn't
have if the Potter's servant hadn't revealed what was lurking beneath
his camouflage. Looked like they'd have to start taking house elves
into account when they made security plans. </FONT></FONT>

sagged and seemed to melt onto a chair as soon as she was sure the
Ministry's inspector wasn't going to return. She shared a look with
her cousin, neither of them had so much as heard of an inspection
that had gone half as well, not even one conducted on a business
belonging to Lucius 'the Minister's in my back pocket' Malfoy.</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
told you there was nothing to worry about,” Hermione sniffed. “Like
you said; Harry arranged everything. If Harry says something's been

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Don't

asked hopefully, tongue darting over her lips as she contemplated the
possibilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Like
what?” Hermione prompted, eyeing the girl with no small amount of
suspicion. It wasn't that she distrusted her two business partners
per say, but Harry already had a lot of time consuming activities on
his plate and she was more than a bit reluctant to add to them if she
didn't have to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ministry
isn't the only one that asks for donations,” Daphne said sourly.
“More than a bit surprised that no one's come by to ask us to pay
'insurance' to keep any 'accidents' from happening to our business.”
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Likely

also be their new partner's staff, she reflected to herself, no one

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry's
already looking after our business.” Her lips pursed as she
considered the matter. “I could ask Harry to look into it for your
father's businesses when he has a spare moment if it's really
important,” Hermione offered. “Just realize that it might take a
while before he has a spare moment.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>

entire attention was on the corpse of the great serpent. It filled
the entire chamber, coiling from one end to the other, two sword like
fangs jutting from the thing's half closed jaws. How in the hell had
the Potter done this even with the aid of a phoenix? He'd have laid
odds on it against any three of the security dragons and counted
himself fortunate for every sucker dumb enough to take a bet against
it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What

away from the corpse. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Humans
can't kill a beast like this when they're children either,” the
older goblin replied. “How sure are we that he's a human. Sprocket
says the Granger Heiress is a goblin in human skin and we're still
not sure what the hell the Potter's house elf really is.” The old
goblin turned to his subordinate. “Find out everything else you can
about the Potter's triumphs and gather what evidence you can as well.
Higher ups and analysts are going to want every detail you can ferret
out.” </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >So
are the story tellers,” Hooktooth added faintly. “The Potter has
already performed at least one deed worthy of a saga.” He waved his
hand at the evidence of the boy's triumph. “Imagine what other
tales are lurking in his past.” </FONT></FONT>

noted with approval the way the maintenance personnel watched him as

could be trusted and the return of Voldemort meant a little paranoia
was warranted. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >As

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Going
to have to have another word with Tonks,” he muttered to himself.
Both to have her run her own evaluation and to have her speak with
the workers. Dumbledore's decision not to permit any private security
to enter Hogwarts grounds was inconvenient but not insurmountable.
All else failed he'd have the Express crew trained as bodyguards and
the bodyguards trained as crew. Would take longer than he liked, but-</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry,”

did the meeting go?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Fairly
well I think. Managed to secure a few more workers for you including
someone to help you deal with your finances and I may also have laid
the groundwork for a trading deal with Gringotts.”</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That's

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
to mention the fact that the trade deal I'm working on could pay for
some of the raw materials and machinery you're using in your projects
if I farm it out to your import business,” Harry said dryly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That's-”
Hermione cut off as she pondered the matter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Never
thought about where the money comes from?” Harry asked, more than a
bit amused by his friend's attitude. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >It
never seemed important,” she said simply. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Oh.”
Harry took a breath. “Your father wanted me to point out the fact
that your profits go back to you and can be used to fund further
projects.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >They
can?” Hermione blinked. “I'd assumed . . .” she trailed off. “I
suppose a proper foundry might be nice to have.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Not

chirped. “And a heavy machine shop.” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >All

intelligent enough to avoid saying anything offensive.” </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
both maintain that none of the available boys are worth our time,

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
Ministry Inspector looked at the delivery carriage today, father,”
Daphne began. “We tried to do things the way you told us to, but-”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >But
she refused to certify,” her father sighed. “I was afraid that
would be the case after the head of the department refused to
consider accepting any sort of 'licensing fees' until after the
inspection.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >That's
not what happened,” Tracy said. “She asked a couple questions and
then granted a permanent unrestricted license for it and any similar

<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What?”
Tracy's father blurted, eyes widening in shock. “That's unheard

marring his features. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
shared a few concerns with Granger about the inspection. She later

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >We
were unable to get a meeting with him before the inspection,”
Daphne replied. “We've since been able to determine that he was in

afternoon meeting with representatives from Gringotts.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>

workers as we liked from any sector of society and gave his personal
word that he would do all he could to find a place with them if there

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Thank you, Sproket. So you know, we
will be taking possession of a foundry, a forge, and a small factory.
We will be responsible for their maintenance and will be able to use
them but they, along with the coal mine, will be spun off into a
separate entity under my direct control. Expect that more facilities
will be added later. We will also be taking possession of an engine
repair facility, a ship yard, three scrap yards, no less than a dozen
engines with funding to put them in working order, and several
hectares of land.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Yes, Mistress.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“The new facilities under my direct
control are not required or even expected to make any money. We may
use them for our projects, or we may let them lay fallow. We need to
get them in a working state quickly and we need not spare any expense
getting them there.”  Hermione sighed. “I'm afraid we will have
to be a bit slower and more mindful of costs for everything else. Do
you understand, Sprocket?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I understand your orders, Mistress,”
the goblin said carefully. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Why are you taking possession of
several properties that may be drains on your finances, Mistress?”
Anguish asked, looking up from the contract she'd been examining. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“They're tax write offs for the
family,” Hermione explained. “Taking a small loss on them means
we pay less on taxes from other income. Managing them is another of
daddy's tricks to make me spend more time on business and less time
having fun. He knew I couldn't resist making them mine,” the girl
sighed. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“As you say, Mistress,” Anguish
stated. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I'll show you the relevant parts of
the law later,” Hermione promised. “Sprocket, could you let the
new workers know that we're going to start doing the initial surveys
of the new properties tomorrow? I'll be in to meet them and give them
the details after we finish here.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Of course, Mistress!” the goblin
spun on his heels and marched back to the group. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I believe that I have found
something, Mistress,” Anguish reported. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“How bad is it?” Hermione braced
herself. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It states that you agree to wear
clothing deemed appropriate by your mother every time you open a new
facility and that you agree to open any facility that is to be under
your direct control and any company in which at least two percent of
the stock is owned by you personally or by a company under your
direct control. In return you will be personally awarded one percent
of the new company's stock, unless it is already under your direct
control, and in return for acting as your mother's proxy, the Potter
will be awarded one half of one percent of the company's total
stock.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I noticed that, Anguish, it's why it
states that Harry gets one half of a percent for acting as mother's
proxy. Daddy's been taking advantage of his good nature to have him
do it for free and I will not have it. I told daddy that I expected
Harry to be compensated for his time and daddy agreed.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Enthusiastically, the man was
tremendously pleased to have a chance to deepen ties with his
daughter's friend. “Daddy and I also have an agreement to make that
clause retroactive which will give Harry a half percent of the coal
mine.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I see. I will continue my search,
Mistress.” It didn't take Anguish long to find another potentially
embarrassing clause. “It states here that you agree to restore any
motor vehicles older than nineteen seventy and to offer your father
first refusal at ten percent below market.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“What?” The girl's eyes narrowed.
“Where?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“It is burred rather well, mistress.
This section here states that you will restore any historical
vehicles, this clause here states that the term historic will mean
any vehicle made before the year nineteen seventy and that you will
grant your father the right of first refusal for any sales of
restored vehicles.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Where does it give him a discount?”
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Near the end when you agree to a ten
percent discount for any member of the family for goods and
services.” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“I knew it!” Hermione exclaimed, a
frown forming. “I knew daddy'd slipped something else in.”</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“If you knew, why did you sign,
Mistress?” 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Because that's one of the rules,”
Hermione explained. “Don't worry, I'd have never signed this if it
hadn't come from daddy unless you and a dozen or so lawyers had
cleared it first.” 
</P>

closed his eyes and contemplated what he'd do to Bones the younger,
knowing that it wouldn't be hard to snatch the little bint the next
time she left the castle's protections.  Perhaps he'd sample her
several times before throwing her to the beasts and she became ruined

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hermione's
mouth snapped closed as a light blush dusted her cheeks. “What
about Fusion? All I'd need is a bit of heavy water and I believe it

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Send
me a proposal and I'll run it past some people,” he sighed, why did
parenting have to be so much work? He was sure he'd never been so
much trouble to his parents, must be something she picked up from her
mother's side. Making a mental note to mention it to his wife at some
point, he continued. “It's not that I don't trust you, darling,
it's that I don't want you doing things that could potentially be
against international law.” He thought it best not to mention how
flexible domestic law could be in regards to their family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'll
. . . I'll also need a bit of leeway with your new rule,” she
sighed. “The lantern mantels we use have thorium in them which
could be used to make a liquid salt reactor.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >You
may purchase and possess nuclear materials in small amounts so long
as it is lawful for you to do so,” he allowed. He sighed. “You

destruction. No chemical weapons, no biological weapons, no neutron
bombs.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm
not sure why I would, daddy,” Hermione perked up at the
non-restriction. “All I wanted was to experiment with a new power
source to run the train.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Alright,
darling. How about this, you may design a fusion reactor with your
friend. I will see if I can find a plasma physicist or two that knows
about the magical world to assist you. Failing that, I'll do my best
to find someone with related knowledge. In return, you give up
fission for now. Deal?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
start of one, daddy,” Hermione chirped, doing her best to look both
adorable and innocent. “I'd still like a sample of a nuclear
material for a transfiguration experiment I thought up earlier.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
man eyed his progeny with no small amount of suspicion. “What sort
of sample?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >How
about uranium two thirty eight?” Hermione suggested. “It has to
do with one of Harry's discoveries.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >What's
he done now?” Phil asked, allowing himself to relax a touch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Harry
broke the third law of transfiguration when he transfigured an object
into gold. It gave me an idea I wanted to test and I needed some
samples to test my idea.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >And
the reactor?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >If
I'm going to go through the trouble to gather a large amount of
material to experiment on, I may as well have a plan for what to do
with it after I've conducted my experiments. That's just common
sense.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Of
course it is.” He closed his eyes and counted to ten. “Was there
anything else, darling?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >One
thing, daddy,” Hermione chirped, an angelic smile lighting her
face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Go
ahead.” His gut sank, he knew that look. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Aside
from a trivial amount of help with my fusion reactor, what are you
going to give me to make up for the fact that I can't build a fission
reactor?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >I
should have known.” Pride warred with reason as reason pointed out
how much this was likely to cost him. Every penny she thinks she can
wring out of you, pride replied, she is her father's daughter after
all. He just hoped his little girl didn't realize what was going
through his mind, would give her much to big an advantage in the

make a nuclear reactor. She also told me that the main reason she

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >He
was out of the castle and in his workshop a split second after his
last class ended. He had orders to complete, he had exercises to do
and to send back to the stock makers Hermione's da had introduced to
him, he had projects to work on. It was a whole weekend worth of work
and then some. It didn't seem like he had a spare moment and he loved
every second of it. A small part of his mind marveled at how little
homework he had to do, seemed the teachers were willing to be a bit
more understanding when they knew he was working on his future. Who
knew?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Sorry

still have some owl treats. Help yourself while I read it and write
my response.” </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Hoot.”
The much less annoyed owl took him up on his offer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >The
letter was brief, in short she was inviting him to spend the weekend
with the team. They had practice and the excuse given was that they
wanted him on hand to take care of any alterations the brooms might
need. The real reason was burred at the end of her letter. She missed
him, both of them had busy schedules and they hadn't so much as seen
each other in two weeks. </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ron
looked over his unfinished projects, his orders, his exercises, his
homework. Regrettably, he didn't have the time to take her up on her
offer. Ron dashed out a quick reply accepting her invitation. His
work could wait a couple days and it wasn't like he couldn't take
some of it with him to work on when Mandy was busy with her own job.
What he couldn't do was take his relationship for granted, his work
would always be there. She might not, especially if he made a habit
of pushing her aside in favor of his job. His work was replaceable,
he failed in it he'd just have to find something else. He failed his
relationship, he knew he'd never find someone as good as Mandy. </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman, serif"><FONT >Ron
affixed the letter to the owl and watched as if flied off. Wouldn't
hurt to work a bit late, not like sleep was all that important. Maybe
he could get Harry's mad elf to bring him dinner too, he mused.
Wouldn't be too bad if he couldn't, wasn't like it would be the end
of the world if he missed a meal or two. </FONT></FONT>

they took enough Death Eaters with them that every one of the younger
students would make it back to the castle safely. The girl grunted as
something hit her in the side, no time to worry about what that could

of the Potter Security Operatives or the Aurors. Some books would
note that Harry was aided by no more than two or three of his
armsmen, others would note that there were four Aurors assigned to
the town and at least two more that happened to be shopping that day.
Those that did would quickly add that such a small number of trained
wands would have had little effect on the battle and that the main
thing to remember was that the battle had shown the Dark Lord to be
naught but a paper tiger, far from being a man to be feared the
battle had shown that common folk could stand against the best he had

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >The

armed with one of the tools of their trade. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Forgive
me for being away, Mistress,” Anguish said, taking her place beside
the heiress. “The Potter loaned me to Madame Bones for a bit of
work.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >That's
fine, Anguish,” Hermione said. “Do you know what happened?” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Not
enough details to give an accurate report, Mistress, all I know is
that the Chief earned another ballad for his saga,” the goblin
replied proudly, her chin tilting up. The Gringotts auditors would be
burning with jealousy at her foresight in joining his war band early.

to get to the two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >What's
going on, Hagrid?” Hermione asked. There was something about the
half giant's expression that worried the girl. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Death
Eater attack in Hogsmead,” the half giant replied. He held a large
crossbow with the casual air of someone's who's spent countless hours
mastering their weapon of choice. “Come on, we gotta get you two
back to the castle where it's safe.” </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >What

alright, Harry wouldn't let a group of masked cowards take him down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >I'm

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Spikenose
did not jump when the creature that called itself a house elf
appeared before her. Considering the fact that the only way it could
do so was to somehow pass through a dozen layers of wards like they
did not exist, her outward calm was a more notable feat than might
otherwise be the case. </FONT></FONT>

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Oh?”
the goblin's nose caught the distinct scent of human blood on the
other creature. She smiled mentally at that, figuring the fact that
the fact that he'd neglected to remove evidence of what he'd done,
evidence that he wasn't quite what he presented himself to be was a
sign of trust. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Dobby

</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Do-”
she paused to consider how best to approach the matter. Management
would be pleased at the opportunity to gather more information on the
Potter and the Granger Clan and she personally would like to know
more about the the creature she was conversing with. “Do you have
time for me to consult my superiors and to find a specialist to
accompany us?” </FONT></FONT>

see each other again. </FONT></FONT>

</P>

popped the goblins back to the Forbidden Forest and waved for them to
get to it. He hated to be so abrupt, but he was on a bit of a
schedule. If he didn't get done soon, some other elf might try to
make Harry Potter sir's lunch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >What

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Bad
wizards go too close to Harry Potter sir's Hermy and Looney,” the
elf explained, bestowing the corpses with a look of deep disapproval.
“Darky marks on bad wizards' arms have bad magic and bad wizards'
pockets have bad magic. Dobby can't finish butchering bad wizards for
the piggys until after bad magic is gone and Dobby can't return Harry
Potter sir's Hermy's spikeys till after piggys have been fed.” The
look of disapproval deepened. “Bad wizards are keeping Dobby from
returning Harry Potter sir's Hermy's things and Dobby can't punish
them for it.” There was an undercurrent of barely repressed rage in
the house elf's voice, how dare they make him risk another elf
cooking Harry Potter sir's lunch! Dobby's knuckles cracked as his
fists tightened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Not

tree by a carriage screw through the throat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >To
the house elf's relief, it did not take long for the goblin curse

</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >Put
it in Harry Potter sir's vault,” the house elf replied with a
disinterested shrug. Dobby was a good elf, he had more important
things to worry about than the petty baubles carried by bad wizards,
like what to make Harry Potter sir for desert? A treacle tart
perhaps? On the other hand, he'd just goten a recipe for ischlers,
perhaps Harry Potter sir would like to try something new? </FONT></FONT>

noted the way her best friend hunched over as they overheard each new
scrap of rumor from the younger years milling about the hallways.
Harry Potter had dueled a hundred Death Eaters, Hogsmeade was
burning, Neville Longbottom had saved them all at the cost of his
life, the upper years were all dead, everyone in Hogsmeade was dead,
Harry Potter was barely clinging to life, the Dark Lord himself had
arrived and Harry Potter had fought him off. Each was worse than the
last, each suggested that Harry would be lucky to look as good as
Moody if the healers managed a miracle. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >&quot;I'm

<P>“<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >How's

<p>Amelia was in her office attempting to make a dent in the mountain of paperwork she'd been cursed with when the door opened to admit one of her aides. Her blood went cold at the expression on the man's face.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Attack on Hogsmeade, Boss.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Susan?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Confirmed safe along with Hannah. Looks like they wanted to kill as many students as possible and Potter in particular.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“How bad?” she braced herself for the worst.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Potter's alive, report says that most of the bad guys aren't. Don't have anything definite, still waiting for the quick response to report back with more than just an initial size up.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Get everyone we've got, tell them we're going to Hogsmeade to help with the clean up.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“We'll be ready in four minutes, boss. Healer Rage says she'll have a team from St. Mungos in eight.”</p>

<p>Hermione recognized six of the twelve people surrounding Harry's bed, they all worked for him. Her eyes narrowed a bit as she tried to figure out who the other half were.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Healer Chalmhers,” Luna called out. “Do you remember me?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“How could I forget the girl who accidentally transfigured her hair into horns and snakes!” the woman laughed. “How are you, Luna.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You're here to look after Harry?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Healer Devon and I.” She indicated the man on her left. “Are here to help everyone we can. The attack filled the hospital wing, it filled St. Mungoes, it filled the clinic at Hogsmeade, and it filled a couple other places. It's bad, Luna, only consolation we can offer is that it would have been a great deal worse without that young man.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Can we have a moment with him?” Luna asked. “He's our very good friend and we were very worried about him.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Take as much time as you need,” the healer agreed, motioning for the others to give the two girls a bit of privacy.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Are you pondering what I'm pondering, Luna?” Hermione whispered.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I don't know, Hermione,” Luna whispered back. “I'm pondering how fun it would be to gently show a few prominent Death Eater families our disapproval of their attempt on Harry's life.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Gently?” Hermione asked, a smile forming on her face as she contemplated the mayhem to come.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Regrettably, showing proper disapproval would create an unacceptable hardship for innocent people in the fallout pattern.” Luna sighed. “Shame your father wouldn't let us build a fusion reactor.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Nothing says 'you annoyed me' better then tactical nuclear weapons,” Hermione agreed. “Come, Luna, we have work to do.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Alright, Hermione.” Luna bent down to give Harry a soft kiss on the cheek. “Let's get dangerous.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Let's show them why you never anger an Engineer,” Hermione agreed, bending down to kiss Harry's other cheek. “Let's show them why it's better to cut your own throat than cross a Granger.”</p>

<p>Flint was pleasantly surprised to find the goblins still in the room at the Three Broomsticks.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“It's Potter's assistant,” the guard at the door announced.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“By all means, invite her in,” the senior goblin said with a wide toothy smile. “Welcome, fellow warrior, please do not take it as an insult that I brought so few guards.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I am here alone and without my Chief,” Flint said formally. “Even with him, there would be no insult, I doubt you have enough fighters in the nation to match him.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'd have taken that statement as a boast and an insult before witnessing what I did today,” the senior goblin laughed. “Now? Now all I can do is admit the truth of it. A goblin misfortunate enough to have been a human, what a loss to the clan. What brings you here, warrior?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I am here to convey my Chief's regrets that he was unable to attend this meeting,” Flint replied. “The only excuses I have to offer are that it is not in my Chief's nature to turn from a fight, not even for a negotiation with a goblin as skilled as yourself and that it is not in my nature to permit my Chief to risk unnecessary harm to himself by delaying medical attention.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, I noticed you stun him when he tried to keep the appointment,” the senior goblin agreed. “Why?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Part of the job's to keep the Chief safe from everyone including himself,” Flint explained. “I didn't do it, one of the others would have.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Convey to your Chief that the entertainment he was good enough to provide more than makes up for his lack of presence, I look forward to seeing if his prowess at war is matched by his prowess at the negotiating table. Convey also that we would consider it a privilage to reschedule the meeting at a time and place convenient to him.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Gringotts or the Granger Estate,” Flint “Only places I trust him to not find any trouble.” Flint winched at the goblin's raised eyebrow. “Good point, please allow me to rephrase that.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Proceed.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'd rather he be somewhere with more backup the next time he decides to leap into trouble.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“An admirable consideration.”</p>

<p>The first thing Amelia noticed when she arrived at Hogsmeade was a pair of gibbets bracketing the town gate.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Get that thing down before some idiot gets a picture of it,” the Head of Magical Law Enforcement ordered. “We know who's in it?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Think it's Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange, boss,” Auror Partridge, the senior Auror on scene replied. “They're a bit cursed up to tell for sure. As for your orders, well-” the woman bit her lip. “Townspeople are a bit touchy about that, only reason they're still up.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Amelia considered what the woman had said. “We getting any prisoners?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Not many, boss, weren't getting any from the local SAR teams till an incident with two of ours.” The Auror glanced around. “Two of ours had to save a couple of theirs from the citizens. I understand that there was some talk about building a gallows and putting ours next to theirs if ours pushed the matter too much.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What stopped them?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Flint arrived, told 'em we weren't saving the bastards from the crowd, we were saving them for Potter's pet auditor.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I take it the crowd accepted that?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Citizens have turned in a couple of the bastards after word got around, none of them in good shape but I guess ya gotta make allowances.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Anyone asks why we're cutting them down tell them that leaving the bastards up is a public health hazard, same as if we left a pile of dung to sit in the street. Have a couple healers back you up if you think it'll help.” Amelia suppressed a grin. The townspeople were murderous, aware they'd survived and enraged almost beyond belief at their attackers. The Dark Lord had intended to sow fear, instead he'd sown the seeds of his destruction.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, boss.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Amelia looked around. “Who are all the people on brooms?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Professional Quidditch teams, boss. Harpies arrived first, Cannons weren't too far behind. They brought their team healers, they brought their team security, everybody. Been really useful to have too, boss. Saved a lot of lives.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Hastings!” she bellowed, summoning one of her junior aides. “Make a note of which teams are here, I want to be sure they're properly recognized for their help.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Got it, boss.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What else do we have?” Amelia asked. “Who's in charge here anyway?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Flint's been in overall command here, boss,” Partridge replied. “I was the senior Auror on scene till you got here.”</p>

<p>Susan and Hannah were waiting when they walked out of the hospital wing and enveloped their friends in a group hug.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“How's Harry?” Susan asked.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Fine,” Hermione said, her face colored with relief.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'm sorry,” Susan said suddenly, looking guilty. “Hannah and I were safe at your house when Harry was fighting for his life.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Susan's security portkeyed us there,” Hannah explained.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“There's no need to feel guilty about doing your job,” Hermione recited. “Ms. Jane taught me that when I was a little girl, some people fight and some people run. Only reason to be ashamed of running is if it's your job to fight, if it's your job to run you should feel ashamed of fighting unless you have no other choice.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What are you going to do, Hermione?” Susan asked, seeing the expression on her friend's face.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Respond, Susan, I'm going to respond.”</p>

<p>Dumbledore face could have been carved out of wood, gone was his normal smile, gone was the twinkle in his eye, gone was any hint of emotion.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I am afraid I can not allow that, Nymphadora,” Dumbledore stated. “You see-”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Either we move at least two dozen of mine into the school or I'm pulling Hermione and Susan out of it,” Tonks said bluntly. “At a guess, Harry, Luna, and a few others would come with them.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Nymphadora, I-.” Dumbledore began.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“It took us five bloody minutes to get to Hermione,” Tonks growled. “She was on the edge of the wards and we didn't have eyes on because you insisted we stay out of the castle grounds. We got lucky with Susan, wanted to visit her detail so she was with us when things went bad. At a minimum; I'm moving people into Hogwarts, we have eyes on twenty four hours a day, and we're moving several students out of whatever house they're in and into Gryffindor or Hufflepuff or somewhere else to simplify the security situation. That's not up for negotiation, would you like to know what is?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Nymphadora, I understand your concerns but-”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Please excuse us for a moment, Ms. Tonks,” Minerva interrupted, heading off the explosion. “Albus and I need to discuss a few things.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Discuss them quick,” Tonks barked, glaring at the old man. “I have no patience at all when it comes to the safety of my charges.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Understandable,” Minerva agreed, “I have a similar attitude regarding the safety of my students.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Minerva waited until the younger woman was out of the room and the privacy wards were up before turning on the Headmaster. “Why the bloody hell shouldn't we have as many guards for the children here as we can possibly get?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Because despite everything, we are still a nation of laws,” Dumbledore said tiredly. “If I were to permit one student to bring in their personal guards, I would have no choice but to allow others to do the same. I do so and we both know that it will result in Lucius Malfoy bringing in as many vipers as possible.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“So hire bloody security for the school. We have the funds for it, don't we?” the woman demanded. “Hell, Harry would probably give us a discount if we asked nicely.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Dumbledore stared at his deputy. “Say that again, Minerva.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What? That we have the funds to hire extra security? Or that Mr. Potter would give us a discount?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes,” Dumbledore agreed, a smile forming on his face. “The school will hire security and we will tell the families that they are also welcome to hire extra security but only if they come from an approved security company.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'll just send a note to Mr. Potter's assistant that you want a moment of his time,” Minerva agreed, a matching smile on her face. “Shall I tell Ms. Tonks that we have a possible solution?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Please do, Minerva. I fear that I shall have to impose on you to look after the school after that,” the old man sighed heavily. “I fear that I will be busy the rest of the day. We are missing several students and one professor.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“There's a chance they were evacuated directly to one of the hospitals, Albus.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Let us hope we are so fortunate. I will be in Hogsmeade aiding in the search efforts if you need me, Minerva. While there, I will also do my best to identify the fallen. Much as I loath to say it, I dearly hope that every one of them is a former student with a coiled serpent on their arm.”</p>
<p></p><br>

<p></p><br>
<p>The sound of china clinking together brought Harry to full wakefulness. For what seemed like hours he'd been drifting in the space between sleep and consciousness, vaguely aware that he was in the hospital wing and unable to find the motivation to do more than simply exist.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Hello, Dobby,” he said, pushing himself up.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Hello, Harry Potter Sir!” Dobby said, his grin threatening to split his face. “Dobby has brough lunch for Harry Potter sir.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank's, Dobby.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Dobby, Dobby has a favor from other elvies to ask from Harry Potter sir.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What can I do for you, Dobby?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Other elvies ask Dobby to ask Harry Potter sir to find them more work.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Not Winky, but Dobby thinks Winky would want to be in a family not as a worker.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Tell her to talk to Hermione about it,” Harry suggested.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky is afraid Harry Potter sir's Grangy will try to give her clothes again,” Dobby admitted with an embarrassed look on his face.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Tell Winky that Hermione was trying to free the elves because she found out how the Malfoys treated you and because she heard that house elves see their family as their family.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Dobby doesn't understand the second part, Harry Potter sir.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Hermione took it seriously when she heard that house elves look after their families because they're their families,” Harry repeated. “She sees the staff that takes care of her as members of her family. She was horrified to hear how bad families treat their house elves, just as she was horrified to hear how the</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Dursleys treated me. She sees giving elves clothes the same way she'd see the police rescuing abused children.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Dobby understands,” the house elf said, eyes wide. He'd never heard of a human with such an elvish attitude, another bit of evidence to support his theory that Harry Potter was the greatest wizard who would ever live. No one else could have explained that his Grangy's actions were were due to familial love rather than a desire to make all elves miserable as had been the prevailing theory in the kitchens. He should have expected no less from the wizard who called a house elf, friend.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Happy to be of service.” Harry's joints cracked as he sat up. “How many elves?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“As many as work can be found for, Harry Potter sir,” Dobby replied.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Remind me to write a letter to Phil Granger after lunch,” Harry said after a moment of thought. “I know he has a lot of places to clean. Oh, and remind me to talk with Hermione the next time she comes up. We'll see if we can't get Winky a new family and I doubt Winky alone could clean all Hermione's toys.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, Harry Potter sir,” Dobby nodded, eyes wide.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“So, what'd you bring me?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Dobby brought all of Harry Potter sir's favorites.” The house elf's ears drooped. “Dobby is sorry he couldn't help Harry Potter sir with the bad wizards, Dobby was busy removing dangerous vermin from the forbidden forest.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Nothing to be sorry for, Dobby, you were busy and that's that. Do you have anything you have to do now or can you join me?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Dobby will stay,” the house elf said, touched that the Great Harry Potter sir would ask him, a mere elf to dine with him. Truly he was blessed to serve the greatest wizard of them all.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Great, meals are always better when you have good company.”</p>

<p>Neither Hermione nor Luna said a word until they were both back in the engine shed surrounded by the engines and technicians.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Anguish, gather our people together,” Hermione ordered. “I wish to address the to discuss the fact that there has been an attempt on Harry's life.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Harry is much too good natured to take it personally,” Luna added. “Which is why we're going to respond for him.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“We're doing nothing less than he would do if they tried to harm us,” Hermione agreed. “The fact that he is not willing to deliver an appropriate response to attacks on his own person is something we shall have to address at some point in the future.”</p>

<p>Hermione's uncle paused at the door, the meeting was unexpected and his superior had an odd look on his face. Neither thing was good in his line of business.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Come in, James,” Charlie said, waving for Hermione's uncle to enter the room. “Have a seat.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What's wrong?” Hermione's uncle asked calmly.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You're mixing me a drink, you're mixing it the way I like it rather than the cover, and you're using the good stuff. What's wrong?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I initially called you in to discuss the attempted assassination of your niece's young gentleman. We've recently been given evidence showing that your niece was also targeted.” Charlie gave an actual smile. “It was handled appropriately. At approximately the same time as the attack, we uncovered an unrelated plot to kidnap your sister.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Bad things usually come in threes.What else?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“There isn't any easy way to say this, Jim. We've known each other a long time and-” Charlie pursed his lips and straightened his back. “My lord, I regretfully inform you of the death of your father.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Jim sighed. “It's over then, old bastard finally let go.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Orders from the very highest level state that you are to be removed from active service effective immediately.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Has my replacement been chosen yet?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“He has, Jim. Good man, come up from SBS.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Carrying on the tradition,” Jim sighed heavily. “Pass on a message from me, would you?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I don't know how many men have had the name, number, and cover since the first, but I'd like to pass on some words I wish my predecessor had been alive to pass on to me; Including the first, I'm the fourth to have held the position and lived to see retirement. Try to be the fifth.” Jim exhaled deeply. “What now?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“The very highest level has expressed their desire to see you take your proper place in society,” Charlie replied. “She wished me to add that you have done more than your part, you deserve a rest.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Wonderful sentiment, let's hope the world lets me have it. You know what happened to one of my predecessors when he tried to give things up to marry and settle down, it destroyed him.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“We've gotten better at preventing that sort of thing.” Charlie drained his drink and began making himself another. “Buck up, Jim, it could be worse.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yeah, I could be saddled with your job.” Unfortunately for Hermione's uncle, he failed to notice the gleam that appeared in the other man's eye at those words.</p>

<p>A smile appeared on Voldemort's face as he contemplated the information his spy had delivered. A chance had presented itself, one that would make his defeat at Hogsmeade appear to be part of a brilliant plan, one which in one fell swoop could deliver victory over the fools that opposed him.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The Dark Lord arose from his throne, this was too important to leave to an underling. He would lead the attack himself.</p>

<p>The goblins' eyes shone with malice as their mistress discussed her plans. Techs they may be, rear support they may be, but in each of them beat the heart of a warrior. The bastards had made a fatal mistake when they chose to crawl out of their holes to pick a fight with Clan Granger!</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I want everyone to start keeping notebooks,” Hermione said loudly. “Put any ideas in them you get for new technology or improvements on what we already have, especially for things that will be useful for what we have to do. You work for me, that means that you're the best at what you do, I wouldn't have anyone else in my employ.” The girl paused, smiling as her people cheered wildly. “Don't let anyone tell you different, not even yourselves. You are the best, the future will prove it. Does anyone have any questions or ideas?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“One, mistress,” Anguish spoke. “I would suggest incorporation the company under goblin law. It will provide a modest tax break and make it much more difficult for the Ministry to take action against us without provoking conflict with Gringotts.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“It won't stop us from carrying out the plan, will it?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I will double check with the legal team, but it should not, mistress.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Do so and do it if there aren't any problems,” Hermione ordered. “Anyone else?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Sprocket raised his hand. “I have an idea, mistress.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What is it, Sprocket?” Hermione asked eagerly.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Most of our opponents live on country estates, but not all of them. We'll need a way to go after the ones in the city too.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Do you have a solution?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I might, mistress, I would like to request an hour to check if my idea is viable before presenting it.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Granted. Let me know either way, sometimes it's more valuable to know if an idea won't work. Good work, Sprocket. Anyone else?”</p>

<p></p><br>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“We found Professor Sprout, boss.” The man squeezed his eyes shut, trying to keep composure. “She didn't go easy.”</p>

<p>Harry had a sudden thought as he finished his meal. Maybe he wasn't as alone as he'd thought he'd been.</p>

<p>“You know, Dobby.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, Harry Potter sir?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I just thought of something, Hermione's staff is her family. For me, my friends are my family. Don't have many blood relatives, don't have any close blood relatives that I'm willing to claim, so that will have to do. Sound good, Dobby?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Is . . . is Harry Potter saying that Dobby is not his friend, that Dobby is his family?” the house elf asked slowly.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Can't it be both?</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Dobby rocked back on his heels, that was almost unprecedented. Very few families reciprocated the love their elves gave them, there were no words to describe Harry Potter's greatness for combining familial love and friendship. “Yes, Harry Potter sir,” Dobby said thickly. “Yes, it can be both.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Good.” Harry yawned. “Gives us another reason for us both to live through this mess, eh, Dobby?” The boy yawned. “Let's work towards a world where little Potters can have a meal with their uncle Dobby and his kids without having to worry about all the garbage we've had to deal with.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, Harry Potter sir,” the elf whispered as his friend drifted off to sleep, his eyes filling with tears. “Dobby will do all he can to see that world.”</p>

<p>Ms. Jane arrived to find her charge crouched over a drafting table, her pen darting over the paper as she designed something that would no doubt revolutionize the world. She'd always been proud of her little reader's insatiable thirst for knowledge and was pleased to see the girl using it constructively.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Hermione.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The girl gave a start. “Ms. Jane? What are you doing here?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Representing your parents,” the librarian stated. “I'm sorry, darling, but I have some bad news.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>She braced herself. “What is it?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'm sorry, darling, it's your grandfather. He passed away this morning.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“He passed away after the last stroke,” Hermione disagreed. “Uncle Jim says his body just kept going out of habit.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I made peace with it after he had his stroke,” Hermione replied. “Was there anything else?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“They wished me to check on your health and safety,” Ms. Jane replied. “They would have come themselves but there was an incident. Both are fine, but you know how these things can go.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What a day,” Hermione sighed. “No one was hurt, were they?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Not even the bad guys,” Ms. Jane assured her charge. “Your mother wanted me to pass on that she expects you to spend the weekend at home, your professors will be notified.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Can Luna come?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You may bring as many people as you need,” Ms. Jane allowed.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank you. Please notify my parents that Harry will also be coming along.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Alright, darling.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The girl stared blankly at her half completed diagram. “Ms. Jane?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, darling?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Does Harry have people watching out for him like I have people watching out for me?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“He does, darling.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Have them doubled,” Hermione ordered, eyes flashing. “There are either not enough right now or they aren't good enough.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“To be fair to them, darling, his reaction to seeing a group of masked killers was to dive into the middle of them and the only reason his injuries are so minor is because his people killed everyone that looked at him crosseyed.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Alright, tell them they have my thanks for doing a good job and double them.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Ms. Jane smiled. “I'll see what I can do, darling. How are you dealing with what happened in Hogsmead?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione smiled. “I'm just trying focus on a new project to keep my mind occupied.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Ms. Jane leaned forward to inspect the girl's drafting board and in an instant her mind went back to the day she'd been hired to look after Phil Granger's only daughter and the first orders he'd given. Seemed Hermione had taken more after her father than anyone had previously realized.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I will be involved in the planning once this gets completed and you are ready to use it, darling,” Ms. Jane said firmly. “Is that understood?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, Ms. Jane. You aren't going to tell daddy, are you?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Not unless he asks some very direct questions, darling.” She gathered the girl into a hug. “Remember, darling, I'm on your side. That means I'm here to help and the first help I'm going to provide is to suggest you work on a few other projects so that I can give your father a couple harmless examples when he asks.”</p>

<p>A wave of relief washed through Amelia when she got the final numbers. Hogwarts had lost a professor but it had not lost a single student. It was a minor miracle that none of the children had been lost especially considering the fact that a group of students had been at the vanguard of the counter attack.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Simms!” she barked. “What's the status of the prisoners?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Transferred to the secure holding area, boss,” her aide replied.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Amelia noticed one of her senior forensics techs approaching with a wide grin on her face. “What do you have for me, Fletcher?” she asked eagerly.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Add at least seven more, boss,” the forensic tech said smugly. “I think I've figured out what those puddles are from.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What?” Amelia demanded.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Potter hit the Death Eaters with a spell that prevented the water in their bodies from going along when the portkeys activated. They'd have been dead the moment they left.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Wonder how the bastards on the other end took it when the mummies arrived,” Amelia laughed.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Probably took it as a warning,” Fletcher said thoughtfully. “Who knows, something to ask the next time we get a prisoner anyway.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“True,” Amelia agreed. “Report what we've found to the Pinch and the Hogwarts Professors.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Cause I'd kill to know how Potter did it,” Amelia said feraly. “Imagine how much fun it would be to hit a group of the bastards with it the next time we caught them torching a family.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'll get right on it, boss,” the tech agreed with a matching grin.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Martin! I want-” the woman froze, her connection to the wards at the Ministry demanding immediate attention.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Boss?” the man prompted.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“The Ministry is under attack,” she stated, son of a bitch was trying to take advantage of the fact that the majority of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was all in Hogsmeade. “Gather up what we've got and contact Potter Security and ask for anyone they can spare.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, boss.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<P><BR></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P><P><BR></P>
<p></p><br>
<p>A look of confusion formed on the Minister's head of security. The wards were informing him of the arrival of dozens of individuals, none of which appeared to have checked their wand at the front desk per policy. His confusion transformed into alarm when the wards began screaming that lethal spells were being cast.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Perkins! Wilks! Teddybear, I repeat, Teddybear!” he ordered causing the two largest members of the detail to kick open the door to the Minister's office, grab their charge, and activate the escape plan.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What's going on, Gavin?” the Minister's secretary asked.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Death eater attack, I'd wager,” he replied cheerfully. “Well, gentlemen, I suppose the time has come to earn our pay. We may not win this fight, but by god they'll know they were in one.”</p>

<p>Ms. Jane was sent directly to Philip's office upon her return to the Granger residence. The man was pacing back and fourth in an uncharacteristic display of nervousness.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I just received word from our goblin friends that there was an attempt on Hermione's life during the attack on Hogsmeade. Fortunately, it seems that Harry's people were able to handle things quietly. Remind me to send a bonus along with a request to increase security.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I will, sir.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Phillip took a couple deep calming breaths. “How is Hermione holding up?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“She's doing well, sir, she's throwing herself into her projects to try to keep her mind off what nearly happened.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Phillip nodded, he was doing similar. “What sort of project was she working on?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“There were several, sir. Most of them were to try to prevent or better respond to attacks. One was a way to communicate faster, another was a way to move people faster, that sort of thing. She also wished me to remind you of her desire to work on a fusion reactor.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Have we gotten a response back from the people we consulted?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“We have, sir, they see no issues in her desire to work on the subject or to build working models.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Good. Hopefully a new project with a correspondingly large budget will keep her occupied and focused until after we can deal with the situation.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Regarding that, sir, I would like to be given leave to stay with Hermione to better deal with future security threats.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Phillip smiled widely. “Granted with my thanks. It'll set my mind at ease to know you're there.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Mine as well, sir.”</p>

<p>To Flint's surprise, she found her boss propped up in his bed and reading one of his school books in the Hogwarts Hospital Wing. She'd expected to find him taking advantage of the enforced down time to catch up on missed sleep.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Got a minute, chief?” she asked, catching his attention.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You had a chance to get any rest since the fight?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Flint grinned. “Planning a bit of downtime after I meet with you, chief. Husband has the night off.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Enjoy it. What can I do for you?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Just wanted to update you on what happened, chief. We've been flooded with orders, everyone wants security after what happened.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Hogwarts, the Diagon Alley Merchant Association, the Hogsmeade town council, and four professional quidditch teams,” Flint listed off. “Granger family would like to increase their security as well.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“That's going to leave us awfully thin,” Harry mused. “What're the latest numbers for our recruiting efforts?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Not even close to what we need, chief. Happily, you have a meeting with the goblins this weekend at the Granger residence that may provide a possible solution.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Let's hope that it goes better than today's meeting. How bad were our losses?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“My information's a bit old, chief, but it doesn't look like any students were lost, we've confirmed the death of one professor, three of ours, and an unknown number of townsfolk. Still counting the bastards.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Which professor?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Sprout, boss. She died protecting a group of students.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Hard to think of a better way to go, don't suppose that'll be much comfort.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Flint reached into her pocket and pulled out a makeup compact. “Ministry's being attacked, chief,” she said calmly. “Bones wants to know if she can take some of ours with her when she hits back.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Tell her we'll be down to join her in a couple minutes,” Harry ordered, levering himself out of bed.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Flint sent her reply. “Try to get out of bed and I'll stun you again, chief,” she said conversationally.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Involuntarily, Harry's eyes flicked towards his wand on the bedside table. Flint's wand was in her hand when they flicked back to her. “Nice reflexes.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank you, chief.”</p>

<p>Amelia had expected to follow the plan, to fight a rearguard action while the Ministry was evacuated before bringing the building down on the bastards as she departed. It was a good plan, it had a high chance of success, it was a pity none of the clerks followed it. Amelia arrived to a scene of blood and chaos, the clerks, people she'd written off as useless in a fight, people she'd seen as sheep to be protected, had thrown themselves on the death eaters without regard for their own safety and with a viciousness that spoke of a considerable amount of hate. It was one of the most brutal things she'd ever seen, no quarter asked for or given.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Martin, do what you can to cut them off!” Amelia ordered. The death eaters were in full retreat, looked as if the clerks had followed the plan just long enough to suck the bastards in before they struck. “Why in the bloody hell couldn't they have followed the bloody plan,” she cursed under her breath. They could have gotten them all, Amelia lamented to herself, wiped out every one of the evil sons of bitches at only the cost of a building.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Auror Smyth-Warren cleared her throat. “Got half a dozen of them trapped in the records room, boss. Orders?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Bottle them up for now,” Amelia replied.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Uh, records clerks want to burn them out, boss.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“They heard about Hogsmeade, boss,” Smyth-Warren explained. “They are really unhappy about it.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Amelia felt a flush of pleasure at the news. “I see.” She considered the matter. “Tell them the same thing we told the townspeople, survivors will be handed over to Potter's pet auditor.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Might work, boss,” Smyth-Warren said, sounding unsure. “Their blood's up, hard to talk sense into anyone.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Do what you can and try not to get caught up in it.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Will do, boss.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Amelia shook her head, the sheer number of Orders of Merlin they were going to have to pass out threatened to put a measurable dent in the quarterly budget. Whomever held the contract to make the damned things was about to get very busy.</p>
<p></p><br>

<p>Narcissa's knuckles whitened as she listened to the reports coming over the wireless. It was inconceivable, not only was the dark lord losing, he was losing badly. The battles of Hogsmeade and the Ministry were routs. For the first time in years, she began to believe that Lucius had put them on the losing side. Her breath caught at the report of how few prisoners had been taken and the pronouncement that any prisoners would be handed to Potter's pet auditor. This was a disaster, she had to find a way to switch sides before it was too late, had to find a way to save her son.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Zippy!”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, mistress?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Can you get my husband's files without too much risk to yourself?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Zippy thinks so, mistress.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Do so and move them somewhere safe and secret from me, don't respond to me or tell anyone where they are unless I'm both free and in the presence of Amelia Bones, Albus Dumbledore, or . . .” She considered some of the rumors that had been swirling around. “Harry Potter. “Do you understand, Zippy?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Zippy thinks so,” the house elf agreed.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“If anything happens to me take them to any one of the three and tell them that they're in return for Draco's life.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Zippy will do so, mistress.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Narcissa carefully considered her next move. Probably best to lay low for a bit longer, she decided. The mob had been aroused and were hungry for blood, it would be best to avoid giving them a target until they'd had a chance to vent their fury on someone else.</p>

<p>Voldemort considered his numbers, he'd lost his best, his rich, his elite, his most capable. The dark lord smiled, he'd have had to purge them anyway after he attained total control, he'd lost nothing that couldn't be replaced. It was fortunate that common thugs were so easy to come by, he'd rebuild his numbers, he'd overcome these setbacks, he'd teach the populous to fear again. He considered his setbacks, perhaps it was a good thing the people had regained their hope, they'd fall into a deeper despair after he took it from them.</p>

<p>Amelia tried to put a smile on her face as she visited the makeshift aid station they'd set up the DMLE break room. Hogwarts, St. Mungoes, every clinic in the country was filled to overflowing. They'd won and were in danger of losing more people in the aftermath than they had in the battle.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>One of the wounded men tried to lift his head. He was unrecognizable most of his face was gone, burned off. His other injuries spoke of someone who'd soaked up a massive amount of damage and had kept going until his body had betrayed him.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“That you, Madame Bones?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>She froze in shock. “Popinjay?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Surprised one of the Minister's pet peacocks did their duty?” he asked, the remains of his lips trying to curl into a grin.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Surprised you survived it, Gavin,” she said gently. “I'd heard you were dead.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“My team?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You and Peaks are the only confirmed survivors. I'm sorry, Gavin.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Don't be sorry, they died with no wounds on their backs, congratulate me for being privileged with the command of such men.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You and your men did good, Gavin, you have my congratulations.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank you, Madame Bones.” He tried and failed to sit up. “As head of the Minister's security detail, I am formally requesting replacements and additional Aurors from the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You have them, Gavin.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Good. Hate for anything to happen to the Minister after everything we went through to keep him safe.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'll do my best to keep him alive, Gavin, my word on it. I will no let you our your people's sacrifice be in vain.”</p>

<p>The senior goblin's eyebrow went up a bit when one of his aides showed Shattertooth into the office, a wave of his hand dismissed the junior goblin.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Sorry for the delay, had to have some things checked before I completed my report,” Shattertooth said cheerfully. “Also got a request I'd like to make.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What things?” the senior goblin asked neutrally.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“My suspicions about the Potter and the Granger heiress for one,” Shattertooth explained, seemingly unaffected by his superior's evident displeasure. “Knew no human could do what the Potter did.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Explain that.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Potter's got non-human blood on both sides, suspect a dryad on his dam's side what with the eyes, haven't proved it yet but I have my people looking. Sire was descended from short nose the ugly fifteen or so generations back, only thing that makes sense is that the Potter is atavistic. Still very impressive for a goblin to do what he's done, but much more understandable.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I see. What about the Granger heiress?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Much more interesting, you're aware of the fact that her dam is descended from a former Primus Pilus of the Legio XX Valeria?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“My people have been able to discover that in her many greats uncle was Marcus Rubrius Saturninus.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The senior goblin frowned. “Why do I know that name?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“From several of the sagas. He was a praefecti sociorum of the Ala Prima Coboli Lupi Equitantes Miliaria</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“The one the stories say spent a good portion of his down time on our side of the Vicus?” the senior goblin asked, trying to remember the saga. “The one responsible for the fact that so many of our forefathers were jokingly called Marci filius?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“The same.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Which side?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“The sire, it explains quite a bit about the family. We said she was a goblin in human skin, stands to reason we share blood.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The senior goblin considered what he'd been told for a few moments. “What is your request?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'd like to recruit a band of volunteers to fight under the Potter's banner. Our treaty with the Ministry allows it so long as we are under nominal command of a human approved of by the Ministry.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You just proved that the Potter is one of us.”</p>
<p></p><br>

<p>Fudge seemed resigned when she entered the room, like he knew that there was nothing he could do to dig himself out of the hole he'd found himself in.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What's it going to be, Amelia?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Minister?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The Minister managed a weak smile. “I realized what was happening when your Aurors replaced my people, I'm not going to make this more difficult than it needs to be.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“They replaced your people at Gavin's request, Cornelius. There aren't enough of yours to do their jobs after the fight at the Ministry.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I see.” The Minister took and released a breath. “I'd prefer not to have been killed in the fighting, the two that brought me here would have to be silenced if that were to happen. A trial would be bad for society with all that's happened, best if I were to top myself.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>For the first time in their association, Amelia felt a trace of respect for the Minister. “I'm not here for that, Cornelius. I'm here to talk with you to see if I can't keep you alive and as Minister.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Fudge raised a skeptical eyebrow. “Everyone knows that Potter's only kept me as Minister because he wanted me to fall at the time most convenient to him. This seems to be it.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'm the head of the DMLE, not one of Harry Potter's employees. I promised Gavin that I was going to keep you alive and I intend to keep my promise.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“My last report stated that Potter commanded nearly twice as many wands as you do, do you think you can stop him?” Fudge shook his head. “We've got one war, Amelia, we don't need another.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I think I can convince him to let me handle it,” Amelia stated. “He's reasonable enough to know that he doesn't want the headache of running the Ministry. I say we hire him to provide assistance to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, that combined with a couple laws to make his life easier will hopefully be enough.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“If you think that will work, Amelia,” Fudge agreed. “I'd convinced myself the best I could hope for was to be permitted to resign so he could place you in my chair.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I don't want it,” Amelia said flatly. “Not at all and never that way. History won't be kind to either of us, Cornelius. We'll be remembered as the incompetents that allowed the Dark Lord a second rise, the attack on Hogsmeade, and two attacks on the Ministry. I can live with that.” She grinned. “What I can't live with, what I'll die to prevent is to be remembered as a puppet minister.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank you, Amelia, it's good to know you're on my side.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'm on the side of the law, Minister. Let's get back to the Ministry, there's work to be done.”</p>

<p>The nigh was half over when Dobby began to speak as no elf would willingly leave work undone, not even to hear something so important. Harry's friend spoke of family, of friendship, of a young girl so loyal to the idea of both that she would willingly become the object of fear and hatred from those she tried to save. In the audience, skepticism transformed into belief and shock into something akin to awe. Great was Harry Potter but good was his Grangy. Dobby spoke of plans, of ideas, of the dream that some day young Potters would sit at the same table with their uncle Dobby. He spoke of hope for a better future and asked those present to help him achieve that future. The response was both unanimous and wildly enthusiastic.</p>

<p></p><br>
<p>Luna cocked her head when Harry entered the engine shed. On the one hand it was good to see him up and about. She didn't like to see her friend hurt and laying in one of the beds in Hogwarts' hospital wing. On the other, she was well aware of how many incriminating plans and drawings they had out.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Harry, I don't know if you've been told but you're going with us when we visit my parents this weekend,” Hermione announced, drawing the boy's attention.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Luna took advantage of the situation to shuffle the half formed schematics on their drafting table so that their reactor project was on the top.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Good to know what my plans are,” Harry said mildly.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione blushed. “Sorry, that sounded horrible, didn't it? Would you please accompany us to my house this weekend?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Did something happen?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“My grandfather died,” Hermione admitted.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'm sorry to hear that.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank you, Harry.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What time should we leave?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Either later this afternoon or tomorrow morning,” Hermione replied.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I presume you're coming too, Luna?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I am, thank you for asking,” Luna said cheerfully.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Good.” He eyed the drafting table for a few uncomfortable moments.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Was there some reason you came down to talk with us?” Hermione prompted, drawing his attention.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I came down because I had a couple requests I promised to pass on to you.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Some of the castle elves have asked if they can clean your toys and your mine and all your other stuff.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“For pay,” Hermione said firmly. “It is an insult to a worker not to get coin for their labor.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You hear that, Dobby?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Dobby heard, Harry Potter sir,” the little house elf agreed. “Elves will do for one galleon a month per property.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione's lips pursed.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Is insult to elvies to ask for more,” Dobby said quickly. “Dobby knows that Harry Potter sir's Grangy is too polite to insult her elf friends.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The girl snorted. “Fine, you win, Dobby.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“The other issue is Winky,” Harry continued. “She is not happy as a Hogwarts elf and would like to have a family. Would either of you be willing to accept her into your family?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione's eyes flicked to Luna.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I would have to consult with our family's elf before agreeing to another,” Luna stated.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Your family has a house elf, Luna?” Hermione asked curiously.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes. She's the deputy editor of the Quibbler, Daddy'd been trying to get her to take over as managing editor for ages but she's far to smart to agree.” Luna's smile was blinding. “She also does the rune puzzles.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione took a moment to digest what she'd just been told. “That's great, Luna.” She turned back towards Harry. “I'd be willing to talk with Winky about joining my family.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The elf in question made herself seen. “Winky could have a family again?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes,” Hermione agreed. “But I'll want you to have something to wear better than a tea cosy and I will want you to have pay so that you can buy things for yourself.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky will wear a uniform but Winky will not take pay,” the little elf said firmly. “Family looks after family because they love them. Family does not get paid to look after family.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I will agree to that so long as you agree to never hesitate to come to me if you need or want anything no matter how big or how small,” Hermione said firmly. “You're right, family looks after family out of love and I will not have any member of my family want for anything I can give to them.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione found herself with a sobbing house elf wrapped around her leg. “Winky was so lonely without a family.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You must promise that you will come to me if you ever need anything,” Hermione repeated. “If we are starving and there is only one bit to eat you must be the one to have it.” The girl summarized half forgotten lessons. “Just as you have your duty to family, so do I. Your position requires loyalty and service, mine requires loyalty and protection. That's the deal that's always been given, the fact that others may shirk their responsibilities is no justification for me to shirk mine. The fact that others shirk their responsibilities is reason for me to do everything in my power to rescue my family that I have not yet met, it is no justification for me to shirk mine. I will die before I shame my family like that.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky agrees, Winky agrees mistress, Winky is so happy to be home.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Welcome home, Winky,” Hermione hugged the house elf. “Can you come with us this weekend to meet the rest of the family?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky will be happy to meet the rest of her new family.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Every elf in the castle must be here,” Luna said in wonder.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione became aware of the fact that there seemed to be house elves packed on every one of the rafters that held up the roof of the engine shed. The elves watched for a few more seconds before disappearing as a group.</p>

<p>Amelia raised an eyebrow when one of her senior Aurors walked into her office without knocking and flopped into the visitor's chair.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“It doesn't make sense, boss.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What doesn't make sense?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“The Potter boy is good, good to the point that I wouldn't want to cross wands with him, but just it doesn't make sense. It's Hogsmead, boss, they think he killed just about all the Death Eaters himself.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I talked to a dozen people today, each one admits that they may have hexed one or two, but they all insist that they were just taking some of the pressure off Potter and that Potter did all the heavy lifting. Most I can get them to agree to is that Potter may not have walked away without the help he got. I just don't get it, boss.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“They all know that they threw a curse or two, even know that the people around them threw a curse or two. What they forget is just how many people there were in town that were cursing and not wearing masks. It's a trick of how the mind works, they remember they did it. So that's one. They remember a couple of the people around them helped out. Say another four or five. Six total. Do you think six people can overcome the number of terrorists that carried out the attack?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“No, boss, but there were a lot more than six people. There were at least a dozen of Potter's armsmen and a few of ours that helped out along with Merlin knows how many civilians. Even if you say that one death eater can take three civilians, they still had the bastards outnumbered by a factor of four.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“True. But they don't know that and we're not going to tell them. We're going to tell them that Harry couldn't have done it without their help, we're going to push the story of those two kids who took out five thanks to that asinine book the Weasley twins put out. We're going to talk about the students who fought their way back to the castle, we're going to talk about Frank and Lessie's boy and his group, and we're going to make damned sure everyone knows that they were trained by Potter last year. Are we clear, Auror?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, boss. But why?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“People on our side can't even say the name of the bastard on the other side. I want to give the other side something that inspires just as much hope in ours, enough to push away all the fear and to let decent people fight back. Remember, Potter showed us the way.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Boss?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“One of our new slogans, kid's going to absolutely hate it. Potter showed us the way, he showed us we could win, die on your feet or live on your knees. Print shop's turning out dozens of posters to put up around the alley.”</p>

<p>Harry left the Headmaster's office with an agreement to provide security to the school and the problem of where he was going to find the staff to do it. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“We're going to have to start doing a lot of overtime,” Harry mumbled to himself. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Right you are, chief,” Flint agreed. “And that's without taking into account the fact we've gotten similar requests from Hogsmead, Diagon, St. Mungoes, several Quidditch teams, etc. Goblins state that they might have a possible solution to you if you're available to talk this weekend.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Am I?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You are, chief, already set up.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank you. Anything else I need to do today or should we collect the girls and head to Hermione's house?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Wonder of wonders, you're free for the rest of the day, chief. Researchers are going over something you did during the fight so it's likely best to escape before they decide they need you to generate more data.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Can't find a better reason to get out now,” Harry agreed. </p>
<p></p><br>

<p>Daphne nodded to her cousin as the fire changed color, the connection was as secure as she could make it. Her cousin nodded back indicating that the room was as secure as the other girl's skills permitted. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Are you there, father?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'm here,” the man replied. “Tracy, your father is taking care of some business and will not be able to attend this meeting.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Please give him my best, uncle.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Why did you call for an emergency meeting, father?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I want the two of you to do all that you can to build more ties to the Granger family,” the man stated firmly. “See if you can ally our family with theirs if you can, be sure that the two of you and your siblings are under their umbrella if you can't bring in the entire family.”</p>
<p>Tracy's eyes widened in shock. “We're not going to be neutral anymore?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I trust that both of you have some idea of what happened at Hogsmeade?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“We do, father.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“It was followed by an attack on the Ministry with the same result. People are angry, angry to the point that I'm worried they're going to start forming mobs to take care of anyone no sufficiently against the dark lord. We will declare for the Ministry if we have to, but I think it would be much better to deepen ties with an existing business partner.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Especially one with a close personal relationship with Harry Potter,” Tracy said dryly. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Exactly. Do what you can to deepen ties, try to get me a meeting with the head of the Granger family, and do everything you can to stay safe and to protect your siblings. I've transferred a large amour of galleons to your personal accounts, spend it like water if that's what it takes to keep the family alive.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“We shall do our best, father.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Our word on it, uncle.” </p>

<p>The entry hall to the large Granger country house was filled to bursting with servants and security when the trio of Hogwarts students arrived. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Welcome back, Ms. Hermione,” the butler said with a wide smile. “I trust your time at school has been productive?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yes, thank you,” Hermione replied. The girl nodded thanks as one of the footmen took her and Luna's luggage. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Allow me to take your bags, Mr. Potter,” another of the footmen stated. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Harry will be in his usual rooms and Luna will be with me,” Hermione commanded. “You may take them there.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Of course, Ms. Hermione,” the footman agreed. The staff had come to approve of the boy after his last visit, that approval had grown when they'd heard what had happened to the bastards who'd sought to harm the young Granger heiress. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The butler cleared his throat. “Your mother wished me to pass on that you are to take an hour to freshen up and then you are to attend her in her rooms. Mr. Potter, she requests that you abstain from this meeting.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What about Luna?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“That is for Ms. Lovegood to decide.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I will come with you if you like,” Luna offered. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank you, Luna,” Hermione agreed. </p>
<p>The butler turned to Harry. “Mister Granger requests a bit of time if you feel up to it.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I do,” Harry agreed. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The butler gave a meaningful look to one of the footmen. “Steven will show you the way.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The footman led Harry to the estate's south field where Phil Granger was in the middle of a round of clay shooting.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Ah, Harry,” Phil said with a grin. “Welcome.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Good to be back,” Harry replied. Phil indicated for the boy to select a shotgun. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“See the reports that you're hovering on death's door were were a bit off,” Phil observed as Harry selected a shotgun. “You know how to use one of those?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I remember what you taught me about them,” Harry replied carefully. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Good enough to not kill either of us,” Phil laughed. “Come on.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Harry took his mark and promptly missed the first two clays. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“There was a plan to kidnap my wife,” Phil said calmly, taking his mark. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I see.” Harry waited until the man had fired both his barrels. “Do you have a list of names?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Isn't that what this meeting is about?” Harry looked honestly confused as he stepped up. “You arrange for a quiet place for us to talk, you tell me that a group of someones have decided to top themselves, you give me their name or names so I can be sure they don't make a mess of things.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Having heard what had happened from the goblins and knowing that it was no idle boast, Phil couldn't keep the grin off his face. “Thank you, Harry, but that won't be necessary.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I disagree.” Harry broke both clays. “Well?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“As it happens, they were from the non-magic world. Wife's known as a bit of a soft touch when it comes to charity. Some of those charities are loosely connected to groups that like to take a more active hand in things. Some of those groups, in turn, think that they're also entitled to a bit of funding and are not too happy to be told otherwise.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I see.” Harry took his mark. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Brought it up because I wanted to thank you. It was your people that caught them. They tripped some sort of intent based ward when they were doing their scouting.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Harry broke a clay. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Well done!” Phil cheered. “Tripping that ward caused the guards to take a closer look.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What's to be done with them?” Harry stepped off the mark. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Police are dealing with them,” Phil replied cheerfully. “Whole thing's attracted a bit of attention. We've had several quiet inquiries about getting similar wards.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“From whom?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Those in the know, many of whom would prefer to remain anonymous for as long as possible.” Phil broke two clays. “What I need to know from you is a timetable. How soon can your people start and how long will each ward take to come up.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Will they also need security people to keep an eye on things and to maintain the wards?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Quite possibly,” Phil agreed. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'll have some numbers sent over shortly,” Harry promised. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank you.” Phil made a show of looking around. “There was another thing I wished to discuss while you're here.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Shoot,” Harry replied with a barely suppressed smirk. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“To start with, have you given any thought to where you are going to spend your summer?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Not with the Dursleys,” Harry said firmly. “One nice thing about having a number of dangerous individuals working for you is that your refusals carry a bit more weight than they did without the dangerous individuals.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“True. Any objections to spending the holidays with us?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“So long as it isn't any sort of bother.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“No bother at all for us,” Phil said immediately. “My wife was rather hoping you'd say yes so she'd have more opportunities to introduce you to society. She believes it will make it easier to persuade Hermione to agree to attend events if you're along. She also believes you to be our future son in law and wishes to ensure that you're known by all the correct people.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Harry's eyes widened in surprise. “What?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You are the only boy my daughter has ever shown any interest in,” Phil said calmly. “Personally, I believe you all to be at least ten years too young to think of any of these things, but I'm told things often go quicker in the magical world.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I . . . I agree with you on that,” Harry stammered. “Being too early.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Just a friendly warning,” Phil stated. “Come to me if my wife or Neville's grandmother or anyone else tries to push you into taking things too quickly. I'm afraid they're feeling a bit smug at how well things are going with Neville and my niece and have decided to focus on other targets. The next one is Jim. Be sure not to warn him.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Why doesn't he get the same consideration I did,” Harry asked with a bit of humor. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Well, he's a degenerate cad for one. He's old enough to take care of himself, for two.” Phil signaled for two clays, breaking one. “For three, him producing an heir would make things a bit easier for Hermione in some ways. Finally, and most importantly, the bastard's been stealing my good whiskey for years.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Three works for me,” Harry laughed. “Bugger 'im. Any idea who the lucky girl is?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Think it's one of Augusta's nieces, some sort of librarian or researcher I think. Feel a bit sorry for the poor girl, but I wish her all the best.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<P><BR></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P><P><BR></P>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione's uncle did not have to fake a smile as his blind date introduced herself, perhaps getting to know the girl wouldn't be such a chore after all. Granted he'd have to put up with an appalling amount of smugness from his sister if things worked out, hopefully it would be worth it. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“So, what do you do-” she pursed her lips. “-how would you prefer to be addressed?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The question brought him back to the present. “Please call me Jim,” he stated. “As to your question, I am a man of leisure.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Good work if you can get it, I suppose.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'm hoping so,” Jim agreed. “I was in exports until I received my inheritance.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I see.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Yourself, to both questions?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Please call me Ada. As to what I do, I am currently a researcher.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“What do you research?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Unspeakably boring things,” she stated. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The two stared at each other for several silent moments. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Were you perhaps researching something in Bangkok two years ago?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I was gathering research materials in Bangkok two years ago,” she stated calmly. “Dreadfully boring trip.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I was quite impressed with how you handled the cobras,” he said dryly.</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Some research materials are more challenging than others,” she explained. “You?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Working on a trade deal. Dreadfully boring stuff.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Which necessitated stabbing a man in the throat with a pen?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“It was the only way I could get him to stop talking about his golf game.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Understandable.” She regarded him for a few moments. “Care to pencil in a second date? I've since been-” she frowned. “-promoted to a desk job, meaning the days of gathering my own materials are sadly behind me. It's left me with quite a bit of time and an aunt that has been pushing me to settle down.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I would be delighted to,” Hermione's uncle stated. “It will be interesting to meet with an attractive woman on my own behalf.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Your reputation suggests-” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“For queen, country, and cover,” he interrupted. “Not for myself in quite some time.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Of course, forgive the lapse.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Nothing to forgive, I've found myself forgetting the difference between myself and my former cover more than once.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<P><BR></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT >IIIIIIIIII</FONT></FONT></P><P><BR></P>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione resisted the urge to frown as her mother finished detailing her role in her grandfather's funeral. The girl did not understand why they couldn't just have something private for the family rather than a public spectacle. Wisely, she did not voice her objections for fear of having her mother give a more detailed answer than she wished to hear. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Are there any questions?” Anne asked. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Luna raised a hand. “What will I have to do?”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“We'll have you seated with the family if you chose to come, dear.”</p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“My father too?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“If he wishes to come,” Anne agreed. She turned back to her daughter. “That out of the way, I understand that you hired a maid?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“How did you know?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'm your mum, I know everything.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Hermione sighed. “Winky.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You is calling Winky, Miss Hermy?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky, I would like to introduce you to my mother. Mother, this is Winky, our newest member of the family.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Welcome to the family, Winky. I am very pleased to meet you,” Hermione's mother said with a smile. “Let me introduce you to Ms Valentine, my personal maid.” She raised her voice. “Suzanna, would you come in here, please.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>A petite redhead stepped into the room. “Yes, Mistress Granger.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Permit me to introduce you to Winky, she'll be joining the family as Hermione's maid. Winky, Suzanna Valentine.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“A pleasure,” Suzanna stated. “Do you have time to discuss your new duties?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky wishes to get to work soon, but Winky understands how important it is to learn first.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Wonderful.” Suzanna turned to her employer. “Mistress?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Of course, Suzanna, no need to be formal in front of family.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky, shall we?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The little elf followed the woman into another room. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“First of all, you are responsible for the welfare of Miss Hermione,” Suzanna began. “Health, safety, appearance. If you have not yet attained the skills to do so, I will arrange for your instruction myself.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky can cooks and cleans and sews,” the little elf said, hands wringing with distress. “Winky doesn't understand what Valentinny means with other things.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>The woman paused to consider the mangling of her name. “I am a trained paramedic, I worked for the Metropolitan Police protection command before being offered a place at Mistress Granger's side. My younger brother is a marine commando and is hoping to be offered a chance to become young Miss Hermione's driver after her graduation. I'm the third generation employed by the Granger family and I am by no means unusual among the servants. Can you measure up or do you need me to arrange a bit of training?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky can protect Mistress Hermione Granger ma'am from baddies,” the little elf agreed. “Winky can do some healing, but needs to learn more.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Show me,” Suzanna commanded. The woman immediately found herself immobile. She then became aware of an increasing amount of pressure on one of her limbs, her left arm bent until it snapped with a sicking pop. Teeth clenched, the woman fought to free herself. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky will heal it now,” the house elf stated calmly. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>Suzanna's pistol was in her hand the moment she found herself free. The woman worked her left arm for a few moments, it appeared to be undamaged. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Was Winky good enough or does Valentinny need Winky to demonstrate more?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“That was sufficient for now,” the woman said, stowing her firearm. “Is there a way to prevent anyone else from being able to do that?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Winky only knows that other elfies can stop it,” she offered. “Winky can ask Dobby to ask Harry Potter sir to ask other elfies to protect Grangy family from bad elves if Valentinny wants.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Please do so.” </p>
<p></p><br>

<p></p><br>
<p>The congenial smile dropped off Harry's face the moment Hermione's father was out of sight. “Flint!” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“I'll have a list of names for you by the end of the day, Chief,” Flint stated calmly. “What do you want us to do with it?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Do whatever you have to to find out who else is involved,” Harry ordered. “Keep an eye on the ones in police custody and leave them in one piece if it can be done without coming into conflict with my previous order. I want Anguish to have a long talk with anyone unfortunate enough to have escaped arrest.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Got it, Chief,” Flint agreed. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“See what you can do about making sure the unsavory sorts know that the Granger family is off limits,” Harry continued. “Let me know if we need to make an example.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Dobby can take care of bad muggles, Harry Potter sir,” the little elf announced, making his presence known. “Is no trouble, Dobby can do it like he took care of bad wizards who tried to harm Harry Potter sir's Grangy and Loveygood.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“When did that happen?” Harry asked intently. </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“When Harry Potter sir was dealing with bad wizards at Hogsmeade,” Dobby replied. “Dobby fed bad wizards to pigs and put their things in Harry Potter sir's vault.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Thank you, Dobby, be sure to let me know if you have to deal with that sort of thing in the future.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Dobby will do,” the house elf agreed. “Dobby will tell other elvies the same.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“You want me to give the names to him, chief?” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Give them to me along without whatever else we can find and the three of us will sit down to discuss who does what.” </p>
<p></p><br>
<p>“Got it, chief.” </p>
